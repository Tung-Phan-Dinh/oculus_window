// Everything `tauri dev` needs on disk before the app comes up.
//
// Named for bun's lifecycle, not by coincidence: `bun run dev` runs `predev`
// first, and `bun run dev` is what `beforeDevCommand` calls — so the preflight
// is not a step anyone can forget to add to the chain. `OCULUS_CLI_WATCH=1`
// (set in beforeDevCommand) also leaves the CLI watcher running behind it;
// `OCULUS_SKIP_PREDEV=1` skips the whole thing for a vite-only session.
//
// **The step that earns this script is the `oculus` CLI.** It is a second
// binary in the same crate, and nothing in the dev path ever built it:
// `tauri dev` issues a bare `cargo run`, which builds `app` and no other bin
// target, and `bun run cli` builds the *release* one by hand. So
// `target/debug/oculus` sat at whatever the CLI looked like the last time
// somebody ran `cargo test` — measured, ten days and several subcommands
// stale — while being the sibling of the running app and therefore the first
// `oculus` on a coding agent's PATH (`child_env` in
// src-tauri/src/harness/discover.rs). The agent called `oculus project create`
// and got `unrecognized subcommand`, from a binary that looked entirely
// legitimate. Building it here costs ~25s after a Rust change and ~3s when
// nothing moved, because the library it links is the one the app build is
// about to compile anyway.
//
// Debug, not release, is deliberate: the dev app runs out of `target/debug`,
// so this is the profile whose artifacts are already warm. A release CLI in
// front of every dev start would be a minute of optimising a binary the dev
// session does not use.
