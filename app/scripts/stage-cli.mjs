// Stage the `oculus` CLI as a Tauri sidecar.
//
// The macOS keep-alive LaunchAgent runs `oculus auth tick`, so the CLI has to
// be inside the installed app — a path under `target/` disappears on the first
// `cargo clean` and takes the keep-alive with it, silently.
//
// Tauri's bundler does copy *some* sibling cargo binaries into
// `Contents/MacOS/` (`retrieval_smoke` lands there), but not `oculus`, and the
// selection is undocumented and apparently name-dependent. `externalBin` is the
// documented mechanism and the one `ffmpeg` already uses, so the CLI takes the
// same route: build it, then stage it under the target-triple name the bundler
// expects.
//
// Run before `tauri build` (see beforeBuildCommand); `binaries/` is gitignored.
