//! Tauri commands for the embedding settings — Settings → Library.
//!
//! One backend is *selected*, and search runs against that one. There is no
//! automatic fallback between engines and no fusing of two spaces at query
//! time: `embed_config()` names one engine, every page vector in the `pages`
//! table came from it, and a query is embedded by the same one.
//!
//! That is what makes this a settings page with teeth rather than a dropdown.
//! **Changing the engine invalidates every stored vector**, because the two
//! spaces are not comparable — `Health::check` refuses a mismatch precisely
//! because mixing them yields confident, well-formatted, meaningless
//! rankings. So `embed_set_engine` does not just write a row: it throws the
//! index away in the same call, and the UI has to have said so first.
//!
//! The order of operations in `embed_set_engine` is the whole safety
//! argument, and it is written out at the call site: the setting is the *last*
//! thing to move, so a failure anywhere can leave the app with an index it
//! must rebuild, but never with a setting that claims one space while the
//! table holds another.

///    reads to skip a file; leave one behind and the re-index skips the very
///    page it exists to redo. Failing here leaves the old vectors *and* the
///    old setting intact, which is a consistent state.
/// 2. **Then the table**, in one transaction: the vectors and the per-file
///    `embed_status` that says they are there.

///    with an empty index — an afternoon of re-indexing, not a corrupt one.
