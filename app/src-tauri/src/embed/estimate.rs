//! What the outstanding index run will cost, before it is started.
//!
//! An index run on a Voyage account with no payment method is **most of a day**
//! for this library, and until this module existed the settings page said only
//! "this can take hours". That is the difference between a number somebody can
//! plan around and a warning they learn to ignore — so the estimate is
//! computed, from the same arithmetic the run itself bills against, rather than
//! phrased.
//!
//! Three facts make an exact answer possible without sending anything:
//!
//! * **Voyage bills a page image by its pixels**, $0.60 per billion past the
//!   free grant, capped at 2,000,000 pixels an image
//!   (`ledger::USD_PER_BILLION_PIXELS`, `batch::BILLED_PIXEL_CAP`). Pixels come
//!   from the page box, which pdfium reads without rasterising anything
//!   (`raster::page_sizes`).
//! * **The packing is deterministic.** `batch::plan` is the same function the
//!   run uses, at the same ceiling, so the request count here is the request
//!   count that will happen.
//! * **The pace is the tier**, which the ledger has already learned. Tokens
//!   over TPM and requests over RPM, whichever is slower — on the free
//!   programme that is TPM by a factor of two, and on tier 1 it is TPM by a
//!   factor of a hundred.
//!
//! What this module must **never** do is quietly turn into a limiter. It
//! predicts; `ledger` decides. The one number they share is the spend guard,
//! and this module only reports where the run would land against it.
