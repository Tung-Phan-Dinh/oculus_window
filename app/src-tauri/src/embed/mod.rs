//! The seam every embedder plugs into.
//!
//! Embedding used to live behind the Python sidecar's HTTP port, with a 1.2 GB
//! torch runtime and a 4 GB model snapshot (`Qwen3-VL-Embedding-2B`, bf16)
//! behind it. It is a trait now: Voyage implements it in-process, and a local
//! embedder — should one ever ship — implements the same one. Nothing here may
//! assume the cloud; anything cloud-shaped (an API root, a key, a rate limit)
//! arrives as configuration or as a parameter.
//!
//! What the seam owns is the *contract*, not the embedding: the on-disk
//! artifact, the space every vector in the `pages` table must belong to, the
//! error vocabulary the failure UI reads, and the encoding the blob column
//! expects. It is a deliberate mirror of `parse/mod.rs` — same shape, same
//! three-way error split — so one failure UI can read both seams without
//! learning a second vocabulary.
//!
//! **The measured constraint in `CLAUDE.md` binds here:** what gets embedded is
//! the *rendered page image*, never extracted text, and never an average of the
//! two. That is why `embed` takes a PDF and a page count rather than a string —
//! the backend rasterises (`embed/raster.rs`) and embeds pixels.

// ── Vector encoding ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// This is the one place the Python wire format could not simply be copied.
//
// The sidecar produced its base64 f16 payload itself — it owned a torch tensor
// and wrote `.tobytes()`. The cloud model cannot hand back that exact thing.
// Two parameters are involved and they are easy to confuse; both were checked
// against the real API on 2026-09-17:
//
// * `output_dtype` is *precision*, and names `['binary', 'float', 'int8', …]`.
//   There is no `float16`, so the stored width is never what arrives.
// * `output_encoding` is *transport*, and `"base64"` there does work — it
//   returns a base64 NumPy array, measured at 2048 bytes for 512 dims, i.e.
//   **f32** little-endian.
//
// So a backend can avoid parsing 512 JSON floats per page, but it still hands
// over f32 and the f16 narrowing has to happen somewhere. It happens here,
// once, rather than in each backend: every backend, cloud or local, hands over
// `&[f32]` and gets the same bytes on disk.

/// Truncate to `EMBED_DIM`, re-normalise, pack little-endian f16.
///
/// All three steps matter:
///
/// * **Truncate** — Matryoshka models nest a shorter vector inside a longer
///   one, so a prefix is a valid embedding. A backend that returns more than
///   `EMBED_DIM` is fine; one that returns fewer is a different space and is
///   refused, not zero-padded.
/// * **Re-normalise** — truncating a unit vector does not leave a unit vector,
///   and a backend may not normalise at all. The cloud model happens to return
///   vectors already at ‖v‖ ≈ 1.0019, which is *close* enough to hide a bug and
///   not close enough to rely on.
/// * **f16** — the storage type. Lossy by design; measured recall is unmoved.
///
/// **Everything downstream assumes unit length.** `retrieval.rs` ranks by a raw
/// dot product and calls the result cosine similarity; it never divides by a
/// norm. If an unnormalised vector reaches the table, nothing breaks, nothing
/// logs, and long pages simply start winning. That is why normalisation is done
