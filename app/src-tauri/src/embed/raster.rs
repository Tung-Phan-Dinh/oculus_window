//! Page rasterization — what a PDF page *looks like*, as PNG bytes.
//!
//! Retrieval embeds the rendered page, not scraped text: image embeddings
//! roughly double recall on formula and diagram pages, which is a measured
//! result and not a taste (`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/retrieval.md`). PyMuPDF used to
//! do the rendering inside the Python sidecar (`render_pages` in
//! `sidecar/embedder.py`); cutting Python out of the app takes the rasterizer
//! with it, and MinerU's result ZIP is no substitute — it returns cropped
//! figures, never page rasters. This module is the replacement, and it is the
//! only genuinely new capability in the cloud migration.
//!
//! The renderer is pdfium (Chromium's PDF engine) reached through
//! `pdfium-render`. pdfium ships as a native dynamic library with no source on
//! crates.io, so `app/scripts/fetch-pdfium.mjs` downloads a prebuilt one into
//! `app/src-tauri/binaries/` — gitignored fetched-artifact territory, like the
//! ffmpeg sidecar beside it. See `library_path` for how it is found at runtime.
