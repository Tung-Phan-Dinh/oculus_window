//! The seam every PDF parser plugs into.
//!
//! Parsing used to live behind the Python sidecar's HTTP port, which meant the
//! contract was a URL and a JSON shape nobody could typecheck. It is a trait
//! now, and both implementations live in this process: MinerU cloud over
//! HTTPS, and MinerU's *own* server — installed and started by the user, not
//! by us — over loopback. Nothing here may assume the cloud; anything
//! cloud-shaped (an API root, a token, an upload ceiling) arrives as
//! configuration or as a parameter.
//!
//! What the seam owns is the *contract*, not the parsing: the on-disk artifact
//! layout, the version that decides whether a file is already done, the error
//! vocabulary the failure UI reads, and the order the artifacts hit the disk.
