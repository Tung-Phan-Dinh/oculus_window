//! Tauri commands for the parser settings — Settings → Library.
//!
//! Deliberately the same shape as `embed/commands.rs`, one field over: the
//! same `EngineOption` row, the same rule that a label and a refusal both come
//! from Rust so the page cannot explain a refusal in different words than Rust
//! would use, the same tests at the bottom. Two settings sections that behaved
//! differently would be worse than either behaviour alone.
//!
//! **The symmetry is the control, not the consequence.** What is not ported is
//! the destruction. `embed_set_engine` throws the whole index away in the same
//! call, because vectors from two models share a table, a width and a dot
//! product and share no geometry at all — a search over the mixture returns a
//! confident ranking of unrelated pages. Nothing of the sort is true here:
//! markdown from a local MinerU and markdown from MinerU's cloud are the same
//! artifact, written at the same `PARSER_VERSION` with the same `mode`, and
//! `render` — the module that decides what the markdown says — is shared
//! between them by construction. So switching the parser re-parses nothing,
//! invalidates nothing and needs no confirmation dialog. If a future backend
//! ever does change the artifacts, `PARSER_VERSION` is the thing that moves,
//! and it moves for every backend at once.
//!
//! **Both engines are always `available`.** Availability here is not a
//! reachability question, and making it one would be a quiet trap: a student
//! has to be able to *select* Local and then go start their server, and a
//! server that is merely stopped must not read as an engine that was never
//! chosen. The three-state answer about what is actually listening lives in
//! `LocalProbe`, which is a live status line beside the endpoint field — not a
//! gate in front of the choice.
