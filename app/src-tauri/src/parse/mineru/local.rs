//! MinerU running on this machine, reached over loopback.
//!
//! This file is short, and the reason it is short is the whole design. The
//! cloud client is 1,800 lines because MinerU's *public* API has no per-file
//! endpoint: a batch is submitted as a list of names, one signed upload URL
//! comes back per name, each file is `PUT` to its own URL, and one endpoint is
//! polled until every task reports done. Batching, split-task progress, a
//! daily ledger, two token buckets and a keychain all exist to serve that
//! shape. MinerU's own server offers `POST /file_parse` instead — one
//! multipart request in, one result ZIP out — so none of that machinery has
//! anything to do here.
//!
//! What is *not* duplicated is the part that matters: `render` turns the
//! content list into page records, it does not know which side produced the
//! list, and `return_content_list=true` is what makes that true. The flags
//! below are set to match the cloud client's hardcoded parameters
//! (`client::run_batch`) under this endpoint's names, so the same PDF renders
//! the same markdown whichever backend a user picked. They are not settings.
//!
//! Three things are absent by construction rather than by omission: there is
//! no quota to exhaust, no token to be rejected, and no server text in any
//! error — the last one is the seam's rule and holds here too, even though the
//! server is on the same machine as the person reading the message.
