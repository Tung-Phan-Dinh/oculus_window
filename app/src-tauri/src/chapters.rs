//! Lecture chapters: where a recording changes topic.
//!
//! A two-hour Echo360 recording arrives as one unbroken timeline with a
//! transcript beside it and no visible shape. This module finds the moments
//! worth cutting at — the *candidates* — so that a later stage can name them.
//! It decides nothing about titles, summaries or storage; it produces a list of
//! seconds and how confident each one is.
//!
//! **The picture is the signal, not the words.** The stream this reads is 720p
//! screen capture of a slide deck: no camera, no grain, no lighting drift. A
//! held slide is *dead still* — frame-to-frame mean absolute difference sits at
//! p50 ≈ 0.008 — and a slide change is a cliff (p99 ≈ 13, max ≈ 175). That
//! bimodality is why one number and no tuning is enough: measured on a
//! 42-minute lecture, a threshold of 2 and a threshold of 6 produce boundary
//! sets whose first twelve entries are *identical*, and 19 vs 18 boundaries
//! overall. Only at 12 does the detector start dropping real changes. The
//! threshold barely matters, so there is no knob for it.
//!
//! **That holds for a slide capture and for nothing else.** An Echo360 capture
//! publishes up to two streams, and the argument above is about the one
//! pointed at the projector. A room camera never holds still: measured across
//! five lectures it sits at p50 ≈ 1.4 with a maximum of 20, against the slide
//! capture's p50 ≈ 0.01 and maxima past 175. No empty middle, so no threshold
//! to put in it; no cliff, so nothing to find. A camera is outside this
//! detector's design rather than a harder case for it, and [`detect`] answers
//! that by choosing the right stream rather than by tuning.
//!
//! **Transcript pauses are a tiebreak, never a gate.** Only a quarter to a
//! third of slide changes have a ≥2 s silence anywhere near them, so requiring
//! one would throw away most of the real boundaries. A nearby pause adds a
//! small amount to a candidate's score, which changes what survives thinning
//! and nothing else.
//!
//! **Nothing is cached.** One `fps=1` decode pass over a 42-minute lecture
//! costs ~4.9 s wall (it saturates every core; decode dominates, so the sample
//! rate and the 160×90 frame size are effectively free), and a two-hour
//! recording ~15 s. Re-detecting is cheaper than inventing a table to
//! invalidate, so there is no candidates table and no persisted candidate set.

/// One legible JPEG per candidate, at `<out_dir>/<seconds>.jpg`.
///
/// A seek-based single-frame grab is instant — ffmpeg jumps to the keyframe
/// rather than decoding forward — so this stays a handful of processes per
/// candidate rather than a second full pass. [`GRAB_WIDTH`] lands around 30 KB and
/// keeps slide titles and formulas readable, which is what a model will need to
/// name the chapter.
///
/// **The boundary second is the right timestamp and the wrong frame.** The
/// loudest changes in a recording are the screen share stopping and starting,
/// so a grab taken exactly at one catches the black — and a grab a fixed two
/// seconds later can catch the room's "connect your laptop" splash instead.
/// Either is a frame with no lecture content in it, which silently poisons
/// whatever reads it. So each candidate is probed at [`GRAB_OFFSETS`] using the
/// *same* seek the grab will use (input seeking lands on a keyframe, so a
/// windowed decode would measure a different frame than it wrote), and the
/// earliest frame within [`GRAB_TOLERANCE`] of the most detailed one wins.
/// A blank loses on detail; so does a splash screen, without anything here
/// having to know what one looks like. A recording that is blank across the
/// whole probe set still gets a frame — there is nothing better to write, and
/// a dropout that long is visible for what it is.
///
/// The file keeps the **boundary** second in its name, not the offset one:
/// that is the timestamp every other part of this refers to.
///
/// `on_grab` fires with how many are written so far — five probes and a JPEG
/// per boundary is ten seconds on a long lecture, and it is countable, so the
/// panel says `12 / 50` rather than spinning.
///
/// **A JPEG from a previous run that this one will not overwrite is deleted.**
/// Grabs are written by their second, so a re-run whose candidate set moved
/// used to leave the old set's frames behind — and after [`detect`] that can
/// mean frames off a stream this run never looked at. The lecture whose slide
/// capture failed kept a grab of the room's Crestron splash in its folder for
/// exactly that reason: the one candidate the black stream produced. Nothing
/// reads a frame after the turn that asked for it, so the only thing an
/// orphan can do is mislead whoever opens the folder next.
///

        "Chapter a university lecture recording: choose its real topic boundaries and name \

Lecture: {title}\n\

{dir}/frames/<second>.jpg  one grab per slide change, named by its second\n\
{course}\n\
The outline is the whole lecture as one document. Every line is `second  timestamp  text`: \
either a transcript cue, or a `--- slide change ---` marker for a second where the picture \
changed hard enough to be a new slide, carrying how hard it changed and whether the lecturer \
paused there. {detected} slide changes were found — \
`grep -n \"slide change\" {dir}/outline.md` lists them with the lines to read \
around.{silent}\n\n\
A slide change is a place you *may* cut, not a place you should: most of them are the same \
topic carrying on. And a topic can turn where no slide changed at all, so a boundary may be \
any line in the outline, marker or cue.\n\n\
How to work\n\
- Read the outline across a second you are considering and see whether the subject actually \
turns there. That is the evidence; the frames are corroboration. It is a long file — read \
the spans you want rather than all of it.\n\
- Open the frames you are unsure about. A title slide or a section divider usually starts a \
chapter; the next bullet of the same argument does not. View a handful as images — they are \
pictures of slides, so looking at them is the point; do not hash them or reach for an OCR \
tool.\n\
- Some frames are the lecture theatre's own AV splash screen — a \
room-control panel saying something like \"connect your laptop\" — and not a \
slide at all. They survive when the recording dropped out for a while. Ignore \
them completely and never name a chapter after one.\n\n\
Rules\n\
- Give the lecture as many chapters as it genuinely has: usually 5 to 8, never \
more than {max}. Do not pad a coherent fifteen-minute stretch into three \
chapters, and do not merge two genuinely different topics to keep the list \
short.\n\
- A chapter shorter than about three minutes is a slide, not a topic: fold it \
into whichever neighbour it belongs to. But do not let that swallow a real \
segment — a long stretch of housekeeping, a worked example or a Q&A is its own \
chapter if it lasts.\n\
- The first chapter starts at second 0.\n\
- Every other start must be exactly one of the seconds in the outline's first column. Do not \
round one, and do not pick a second between two lines.\n\
- Titles name the topic in the lecturer's own vocabulary, two to six words, \
sentence case: \"Grover's search\", \"Proving unsatisfiability by resolution\". \
Never \"Introduction\", \"Part 2\", \"Continued\", \"Wrap-up\", and never the \
lecture's own title.\n\
- Summaries are one or two sentences saying what is covered and why a student \
would come back to this span. Say something the title does not — a summary \
that restates its title is worth nothing.\n\n\
