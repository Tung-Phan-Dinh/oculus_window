//! Lecture chapters: where a recording changes topic.
//!
//! A two-hour Echo360 recording arrives as one unbroken timeline with a
//! transcript beside it and no visible shape. This module finds the moments
//! worth cutting at — the *candidates* — so that a later stage can name them.
//! It decides nothing about titles, summaries or storage; it produces a list of
//! seconds and how confident each one is.
//!
//! **The picture is the signal, not the words.** These recordings are 720p
//! screen capture of a slide deck: no camera, no grain, no lighting drift. A
//! held slide is *dead still* — frame-to-frame mean absolute difference sits at
//! p50 ≈ 0.008 — and a slide change is a cliff (p99 ≈ 13, max ≈ 175). That
//! bimodality is why one number and no tuning is enough: measured on a
//! 42-minute lecture, a threshold of 2 and a threshold of 6 produce boundary
//! sets whose first twelve entries are *identical*, and 19 vs 18 boundaries
//! overall. Only at 12 does the detector start dropping real changes. The
//! threshold barely matters, so there is no knob for it.
//!
//! **Transcript pauses are a tiebreak, never a gate.** Only a quarter to a
//! third of slide changes have a ≥2 s silence anywhere near them, so requiring
//! one would throw away most of the real boundaries. A nearby pause adds a
//! small amount to a candidate's score, which changes what survives thinning
//! and nothing else.
//!
//! **Nothing is cached.** One `fps=1` decode pass over a 42-minute lecture
//! costs ~4.9 s wall (it saturates every core; decode dominates, so the sample
//! rate and the 160×90 frame size are effectively free), and a two-hour
//! recording ~15 s. Re-detecting is cheaper than inventing a table to
//! invalidate, so there is no candidates table and no persisted candidate set.

candidates below and name each one.\n\n\
Lecture: {title}\n\
Duration: {clock} ({mins} minutes)\n\
Recording folder: {dir}\n  \
{dir}/transcript.vtt        the whole transcript, WebVTT, timestamped\n  \
{dir}/frames/<second>.jpg   one slide grab per candidate, named by its second\n\
{course}\n\
Candidates (second, timestamp, score, and whether the lecturer paused there):\n\n\
{list}\n\
A candidate is a second where the picture changed hard enough to be a new \
slide. The score is how hard, comparable only within this lecture. Most slide \
changes are the same topic carrying on — so these are places you *may* cut, \
not places you should.\n\n\
How to work\n\
- Read the transcript across a candidate to see whether the subject actually \
turns there. That is the evidence; the frames are corroboration. It is plain \
WebVTT, so read the spans you want rather than the whole file.\n\
- Open the frames you are unsure about. A title slide or a section divider \
usually starts a chapter; the next bullet of the same argument does not. View \
a handful as images — they are pictures of slides, so looking at them is the \
point; do not hash them or reach for an OCR tool.\n\
- Some frames are the lecture theatre's own AV splash screen — a \
room-control panel saying something like \"connect your laptop\" — and not a \
slide at all. They survive when the recording dropped out for a while. Ignore \
them completely and never name a chapter after one.\n\n\
Rules\n\
- Give the lecture as many chapters as it genuinely has: usually 5 to 8, never \
more than {max}. Do not pad a coherent fifteen-minute stretch into three \
chapters, and do not merge two genuinely different topics to keep the list \
short.\n\
- A chapter shorter than about three minutes is a slide, not a topic: fold it \
into whichever neighbour it belongs to. But do not let that swallow a real \
segment — a long stretch of housekeeping, a worked example or a Q&A is its own \
chapter if it lasts.\n\
- The first chapter starts at second 0.\n\
- Every other start must be exactly one of the candidate seconds listed above.\n\
- Titles name the topic in the lecturer's own vocabulary, two to six words, \
sentence case: \"Grover's search\", \"Proving unsatisfiability by resolution\". \
Never \"Introduction\", \"Part 2\", \"Continued\", \"Wrap-up\", and never the \
lecture's own title.\n\
- Summaries are one or two sentences saying what is covered and why a student \
would come back to this span. Say something the title does not — a summary \
that restates its title is worth nothing.\n\n\
Reply with JSON and nothing else, in play order:\n\n\
[\n  {{\"start\": 0, \"title\": \"...\", \"summary\": \"...\"}},\n  \
{{\"start\": 742, \"title\": \"...\", \"summary\": \"...\"}}\n]\n",
