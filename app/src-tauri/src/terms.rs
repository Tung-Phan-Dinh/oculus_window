//! Chronological ordering for Canvas term names.
//!
//! Canvas names a term `"2026 Semester 2"` or `"2026 Summer Term"`, and those
//! strings do *not* sort chronologically: `"Summer"` beats `"Semester"` on the
//! third character (`u` > `e`), so comparing them as text files Summer last in
//! a year it actually starts. Taking the plain `.max()` of the names therefore
//! elected a single summer enrolment over the semester being studied, and
//! every real subject was stamped as past.
//!
//! Not every term is named after a semester either. A short intensive comes
//! back as the month it runs in — `"2026 June"` for `THTR30042_2026_JUN_STH_2`
//! — so the months map onto the term they fall inside: January/February are
//! Summer, June/July are Winter. Left unranked they sorted after every real
//! term, and the same `.max()` elected a one-off intensive over the semester
//! being studied.
//!
//! The year prefix compares fine either way; only the term within a year needs
//! a rank. Mirrored in `app/src/lib/terms.ts`, which the frontend uses to
//! derive the same answer at read time — both sides have to agree, because a
//! stored flag written here is what the CLI and the agent read back.

/// Chronological position within one academic year. UniMelb runs Summer Term
/// in January–February, ahead of Semester 1, with Winter Term between the two
/// semesters. An unrecognised term sorts after every real one rather than
/// silently taking a real term's place.
