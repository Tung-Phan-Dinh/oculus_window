//! Installing a missing CLI agent, from Settings → AI.
//!
//! `discover.rs` answers *where* a CLI is, or that it is nowhere. That left
//! the student's next move outside the app entirely: work out which of four
//! install routes this machine wants, run it in a terminal, come back. This
//! module is the way through, and it is deliberately **not** a package
//! manager wrapper:
//!
//! - **Nothing is installed for you that you were not shown.** Every route is
//!   a literal command string from the vendor's own documentation, displayed
//!   verbatim with a Copy button. The copy path is the one that always works —
//!   no package manager, a locked-down machine, or a student who would rather
//!   run it themselves — so it is offered even when the Run button is.
//! - **The click on a button showing the command is the confirmation.** There
//!   is no other one, and nothing runs without it.
//! - **Nothing that needs elevation is ever offered.** A GUI app has no
//!   terminal to put a password prompt in, and `sudo` under a pipe with no tty
//!   hangs rather than fails; so a provider whose only route on this machine
//!   would need it gets the command and nothing more. [`start`] refuses one
//!   anyway, and a test pins it.
//! - **The webview never names the command.** It names a provider and a
//!   manager; the string comes out of the table below. An invoke that could
//!   pass an arbitrary string to `$SHELL -lc` would be a shell for anything
//!   that reached the webview, in the one app that also holds the student's
//!   Canvas session.
//!
//! Routes are platform-specific. Windows offers native Codex and opencode
//! packages, Antigravity's PowerShell installer, and a copy-only WSL setup
//! command for Claude. The latter can need elevation/restart and therefore
//! must run from the repository in a visible terminal, outside this runner.
//!
//! The commands run through `$SHELL -lc` for the same reason discovery asks a
//! login shell: a Dock-launched app has launchd's PATH, and `brew` is not on
//! it. Output is streamed line by line as it arrives — an install that prints
//! nothing for forty seconds is indistinguishable from one that hung.
//!
//! What this module does *not* do is forget the discovery cache when a run
//! finishes. `discover::binary` caches failures for the life of the process,
//! so a freshly installed CLI stays "missing" until something calls
//! `discover::forget()` — and the webview has a second cache of its own
//! (`app/src/hooks/useBridgeHealth.ts`). Dropping only Rust's here would leave
//! the module-level one stale, so the recheck is the frontend's to fire, on
//! the exit event, through the one path that invalidates both.
