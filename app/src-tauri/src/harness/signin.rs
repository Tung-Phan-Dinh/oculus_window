//! Signing in to a CLI agent, from the error row that says you are not.
//!
//! `install.rs` is the way through when the CLI is *missing*. This is the way
//! through when it is there and its credentials are not: an expired OAuth
//! session, a `claude auth logout` a student ran last month, a machine that
//! has never been signed in at all. Until this existed the whole answer was a
//! red row reading *"Failed to authenticate: OAuth session expired and could
//! not be refreshed"* — true, unactionable, and identical in shape to a row
//! about a syntax error in a file. A student's next move was to find a
//! terminal, remember which of three CLIs this thread was on, and guess the
//! subcommand.
//!
//! The module does two separable things, and they are worth keeping apart:
//!
//! - [`is_auth_failure`] **reads** a provider's own error text and says
//!   whether it is that provider saying it has no usable credentials. That is
//!   a classification over strings nobody controls, so the lists below are
//!   kept tight on purpose. A false positive is worse than a miss: it tells a
//!   student to re-authenticate over a failure that had nothing to do with
//!   their account, and the sign-in they then do will not fix it.
//! - [`start`] / [`submit_code`] / [`cancel`] **drive** the CLI's own login
//!   flow, which is the only login flow there is. Nothing here implements
//!   OAuth, holds a token, or writes a credential file. Each CLI owns its
//!   store and this module owns a subprocess.
//!
//! **The two flows are genuinely different shapes**, measured on this machine
//! rather than assumed:
//!
//! - `claude auth login` prints an authorize URL and then **blocks reading a
//!   pasted code from stdin**. Its last prompt — `Paste code here if prompted
//!   >` — carries no trailing newline, so a `lines()` loop never emits it
//!   until the child exits. That is expected and nothing here waits for it:
//!   the dialog's paste field is offered as soon as the URL arrives, and
//!   [`submit_code`] writes the answer to the child's stdin.
//! - `codex login` starts its **own loopback listener** on port 1455, prints
//!   the authorize URL, and finishes by itself when the browser redirect comes
//!   back. It never reads stdin. [`submit_code`] exists for one of the two
//!   providers and is simply never called for the other.
//!
//! **opencode is deliberately not here.** Its credentials are per *provider*,
//! not per CLI — one store holding an Anthropic key, a GitHub Copilot OAuth
//! token, and two hundred more — and this repo already has the whole surface
//! for it (`harness_opencode_providers`, `harness_opencode_set_key`, the
//! `harness_opencode_oauth_*` pair, and `OpencodeConnectDialog.tsx`), going
//! through `opencode serve`'s own HTTP API rather than a terminal. Driving
//! `opencode auth login` as a subprocess would be a second, worse door to the
//! same store: it is a TUI with arrow-key menus, and it could only write what
//! the existing path already writes. So [`status`] answers `signed_in: None`
//! for it — *not answerable from here*, which is a different fact from "no" —
//! and [`start`] returns an error naming the dialog that is the real answer.
//!
//! **Nothing here is cached, and that is the difference from
//! [`discover::health`](super::discover::health).** Health is asked by every
//! model picker in the app, three spawns a menu, so it is cached for the life
//! of the process and dropped only by Settings' *Recheck*. Sign-in state is
//! asked in two places — a settings row and an error row a student is looking
//! at *because something just failed* — and a cached "signed out" that
//! outlived the sign-in that fixed it would be the one wrong answer that
//! matters here. So [`status`] spawns the CLI every time it is asked, and
//! `discover::forget()` has nothing of this module's to forget. The binary
//! lookup underneath it is still cached; where the CLI *is* does not change
//! when its credentials do.
//!
//! The streaming shape is `install.rs`'s, for the same reasons: one event per
//! line on one `app.emit` channel, stdout and stderr drained by a thread each
//! into one channel (read one after the other, a child that fills the unread
//! pipe deadlocks), and a final `done` event that is always last. Two things
//! differ. The child is the **discovered binary run directly**, never
//! `$SHELL -lc` — there is no user-supplied string anywhere near a shell here,
//! and no profile PATH to need. And it gets [`discover::child_env`], whose
//! strip of `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` is exactly as load-bearing
//! for a login as it is for a turn: a sign-in that landed on a stray key in
//! the shell would defeat the point of signing in.
//!
//! **No deadline is imposed from above.** An OAuth page can sit open for as
//! long as a person takes to find their password, switch accounts, or answer a
//! second factor on a phone in another room. A timeout here could only abandon
//! a flow that was still going; [`cancel`] is what ends one, and a student
//! closing the dialog is what calls it.
