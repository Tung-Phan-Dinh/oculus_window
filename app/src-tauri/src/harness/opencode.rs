//! The opencode bridge: HTTP and SSE against one `opencode serve`.
//!
//! Codex's shape, over a different wire. One server per app — started on
//! first use, killed on quit — and one *session* per thread inside it, with
//! a single server-wide event stream that the reader thread routes by
//! session id. A process per thread would buy nothing: the protocol already
//! carries the session on every event.
//!
//! Everything here drives opencode's **v1** session API — `POST /session`,
//! `/prompt_async`, `/abort`, `/revert`, `GET /event` — each call scoped
//! with `?directory=<the session dir>`, because a bare `/event` or
//! `/session` binds to the server's own cwd, which is not ours. It was
//! written against v2 (`/api/session`, `/api/event`, `session.next.*`
//! events) first and moved, because on 1.18.31 a v2 prompt on any provider
//! signed in through `auth.json` — OpenRouter, for every student — failed
//! inside the server (`ModelUnavailableError`) and emitted nothing, while
//! the same session over v1 answered (upstream #47577 / #47888 / #42737).
//! The v2 translator ([`translate`]) and its recordings are kept until v1
//! has run on real threads for a while; the endpoints are not dual.
//!
//! [`dispatch`] routes each event by wherever its session id is and picks
//! the translator by the envelope ([`fold`]): `properties` is v1,
//! `data` is v2. The parts that are easy to get wrong, and were:
//!
//! - **`--port 0` does not mean "pick a free port".** It means "prefer
//!   4096", and it takes something else only when 4096 is busy. The real
//!   port is printed on **stdout** as `opencode server listening on
//!   http://127.0.0.1:<port>`, and that line is the only place it appears —
//!   `--print-logs` puts structured logs on stderr and never the port.
//! - **Bootstrap is a gate, not a wait.** `GET /agent?directory=` answers
//!   synchronously with the directory's own `opencode.json` already read
//!   (measured: 0.04 s on a never-seen directory, both agents listed), and
//!   the bridge still checks that `oculus` is in the list before creating
//!   any session — a session created without it would run as a built-in
//!   agent with none of the containment.
//! - **The agent and model a session is created with are decorative.** A
//!   prompt that does not name them runs as opencode's stock `build` agent
//!   with its 8k-token coding prompt and no permission story. So every
//!   `prompt_async` carries `agent` and `model` ([`SessionRoute`]), and
//!   the model is spelled `{providerID, id}` on create but
//!   `{providerID, modelID}` on the prompt — each a 400 the other way.
//! - **`prompt_async` answers 204 with no body.** The user message's
//!   `msg_…` — the anchor a rewind names — comes off the stream, as the
//!   first user `message.updated`, and [`translate_v1`] emits `TurnAnchor`
//!   there. The stream is the only place anything about a turn is said.
//! - **Revert is one call, inclusive and lazy.** `POST /revert {messageID}`
//!   drops the named message *and* everything after it, so the anchor is
//!   the question's own id (and the first message of a session can go);
//!   nothing is deleted until the next prompt, when `message.removed`
//!   events say so, and the message list keeps showing the reverted rows
//!   until then. 409 `SessionBusyError` while a turn runs.
//! - **An interrupt is `POST /abort`**, and on the stream it is
//!   `session.error{MessageAbortedError}` followed, out of order, by the
//!   partial answer — see the v1 family below for why the first idle after
//!   it must not close the turn.
//! - **The session id is `properties.sessionID`** on every session-scoped
//!   v1 event, and also inside `info` (messages, and the session itself on
//!   `session.created`/`updated`) and `part`; on v2 it was `data.sessionID`
//!   or the durable envelope. [`session_of`] tries all of them. Thirty of
//!   the eighty-eight event types carry no session at all (pty, workspace,
//!   tui, lsp, mcp, installation, `server.heartbeat`…), so they are
//!   translated and dispatched before the route lookup, into a sink that
//!   belongs to the harness — exactly what Codex does with its
//!   account-scoped rate limits.
//! - **The v2 stream never sent `session.idle`**, and its turn opened on
//!   `session.next.prompted` and closed on the first `step.ended` whose
//!   `finish` was not `tool-calls`, or on any `step.failed` — an interrupt
//!   being a `step.failed` saying exactly `Provider turn interrupted`. That
//!   is what [`translate`] still folds, for a recorded stream; a turn whose
//!   model could not be resolved emitted nothing at all there, which is
//!   where [`OpencodeServer::watch_drains`] comes from.
//!
//! ## The v1 family (`/event`, measured on 1.18.31)
//!
//! [`translate_v1`] folds it, and is replayed from the recordings in
//! `fixtures/harness/opencode-v1-*.ndjson` — a text answer, a tool chain, a
//! reasoning model, an abort and an unresolvable model. What it has to know:
//!
//! - **Deltas for text and reasoning, snapshots for everything else.** A
//!   part opens as a `message.part.updated` with `text: ""` and `time.start`,
//!   streams as `message.part.delta` (`field` is `"text"` for reasoning too,
//!   so the part's type is remembered from the opening snapshot), and closes
//!   as a `message.part.updated` with `time.end` and the whole text. Tool
//!   parts never delta: a running bash re-sends the whole part with
//!   `state.metadata.output` grown, and the new suffix is the delta. Every
//!   snapshot is the whole part.
//! - **One assistant message per step, not per turn.** A tool chain makes
//!   several `msg_…` rows, each `parentID` = the user message, each finishing
//!   with `finish: "tool-calls"` or `"stop"` and emitted twice at completion.
//!   The user row is re-emitted (with `summary`) after every step, so only
//!   the first sight of a user id opens a turn — and that is also where
//!   `TurnAnchor` comes from, since `prompt_async` answers 204 with no id.
//!   The user's own prompt is a text part too, on the user message, and is
//!   not an answer.
//! - **An abort arrives out of order.** `session.error{MessageAbortedError}`,
//!   then `session.idle`, *then* the final text snapshot and the assistant
//!   `message.updated` carrying the same error, then a second idle. Closing
//!   on the first idle would lose the partial answer, so idle only closes a
//!   turn that has no assistant message at all, and the errored
//!   `message.updated` is what says `interrupted`.
//! - **A bad model gets `session.error`, then idle, and never an assistant
//!   message; a bad agent gets `session.error` and no idle at all.** So a
//!   `session.error` closes the turn itself when no assistant message is
//!   pending, and idle is the backstop: outside an abort, an idle with the
//!   turn still open — no assistant row, or one never completed — closes it
//!   `failed`, because nothing else ever will. Each error is sent twice, the
//!   second time as a stack trace (`\n    at …`), which is dropped.
//!
//! ## Containment, and what it does not buy
//!
//! The other two bridges lean on an OS sandbox: Claude's seatbelt profile
//! and Codex's `workspace-write` both make the cwd the only writable root
//! *at the kernel*, so a shell redirect out of it is refused by the system
//! rather than by the agent. **opencode has no sandbox.** Its permission
//! system is a rule list the runner checks before it calls a tool, and for
//! `bash` the rule is a glob over the command string. So:
//!
//! - `edit` (which governs `write`, `edit` and `apply_patch` together — there
//!   is no separate `write` key) is genuinely enforced per path, and that is
//!   what keeps `courses/`, `lectures/`, `canvas-session/` and `oculus.db`
//!   safe from the file tools. Measured, all three refuse.
//! - `bash` is allow-listed to `oculus …` and `ls …` and denied otherwise,
//!   which stops the obvious `rm -rf ../courses`. It is a speed bump, not a
//!   boundary: `oculus files X > ../oculus.db` matches the allowed prefix and
//!   opencode has nothing underneath it to refuse the redirect. This is the
//!   one place an opencode thread is weaker than a Claude or Codex one, and
//!   it is written down here rather than discovered later.
//!
//! Three rule shapes were measured and only one works, which is worth not
//! relearning (`templates/OPENCODE.template.json` is the result):
//!
//! - `{"*": "deny", "<cwd>/**": "allow"}` **denies everything**. The path
//!   check is deny-wins regardless of order, exactly as in Claude's rule
//!   syntax — so the siblings of `agents/` are named individually and the
//!   root is left allowed, which is the same shape `claude.rs` arrived at
//!   for the same reason.
//! - Whichever rule is **last** decides whether the tool is offered to the
//!   model at all. A trailing `"*": "deny"` does not just refuse calls, it
//!   deletes the tool from the request — `Unknown tool: write`. So the bash
//!   map's last entry has to be an allow, or bash disappears.
//! - A pattern for a path **inside** the session directory has to be
//!   *relative* to it; one for a path outside has to be absolute. An
//!   absolute `<agents>/opencode.json` silently matched nothing, while a
//!   bare `opencode.json` refused it. That last rule is what stops the agent
//!   rewriting the permissions it runs under, and `skills/**` and
//!   `.opencode/**` are denied the same relative way and for the same
//!   reason: the generated skills (`crate::agents`) and the directory
//!   opencode would read a hand-made one from both sit inside the session
//!   directory, which is the one place the agent may write.
//!
//! Skills are the one thing here that is config rather than a link. opencode
//! scans `.opencode/skill/` in the project root, and also takes a top-level
//! `skills.paths`, so the config names `skills` — *relative*, by the same
//! rule as the denies above — and the generated directory is read where it
//! already is instead of being copied or linked into a second place.
//!
//! The prompt is the other difference. There is no `--append-system-prompt`
//! here: an agent's `prompt` **replaces** the whole system prompt (opencode
//! then appends its own `<env>` block, the date, `AGENTS.md` and a skills
//! index). So the rendered `HARNESS.template.md` *is* the `oculus` agent's
//! prompt, written into `agents/opencode.json`, and the per-thread part of
//! the brief — the subject, the lecture — rides the first prompt of the
//! session instead, since the config is one document for every thread.

    // ── Providers and credentials ────────────────────────────────────────
    //
    // opencode's catalogue is 218 providers wide and two of them answer,
    // because a provider is only reachable once `opencode auth` holds a
    // credential for it. That store is a file of opencode's
    // (`~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`) and this server is the only
    // supported door to it: `PUT`/`DELETE /auth/{id}` write it, and the
    // OAuth pair below runs the browser flows — including the loopback
    // listener the redirect lands on, which is *inside this process*. That
    // is why the app drives its own long-lived server here rather than a
    // throwaway one.
    //
    // Three facts were measured against 1.18.2 and are all easy to get
    // wrong:
    //
    // - **`connected` is not read from the file.** It comes off the
    //   instance's provider state, which is built once and never
    //   invalidated by a write — `PUT /auth/anthropic` answers `true`, the
    //   file on disk grows the credential, and `GET /provider` keeps
    //   reporting the old list for the life of the instance.
    //   `POST /instance/dispose` is what re-reads it ([`Self::refresh`]),
    //   and the next `GET /provider` is correct. The model catalogue is a
    //   separate question with a separate answer — see [`Self::list_models`],
    //   which reads `/config/providers` and never `/api/model`, for reasons
    //   measured there.
    // - **Disposing is survivable.** Measured: the process stays up, the
    //   event stream keeps heart-beating, sessions created before it
    //   are still readable by id afterwards, and an OAuth loopback listener
    //   opened before it is still bound after. What it does release is
    //   "all resources", so it is not done while a turn is open
    //   ([`Self::busy`]).
    // - **A provider with no entry in `/provider/auth` takes a plain API
    //   key.** Only ten of the 218 declare a method; measured,
    //   `PUT /auth/anthropic {type:"api",key}` on one of the other 208 is
    //   accepted and the provider comes back connected after a refresh. So
    //   [`DEFAULT_METHOD`] is a real method rather than a guess, and one
    //   generic form covers the whole catalogue.
    //
    // Nothing here goes near [`RawLog`]: only the SSE payloads are written
    // to `agents/threads/*.ndjson`, and a credential never travels on that
    // stream. The one place a key could leak is an error body echoing the
    // request, so [`Self::set_api_key`] redacts its own secret out of
    // whatever it is about to return, on top of [`scrub`].
