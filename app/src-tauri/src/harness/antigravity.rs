//! The Antigravity bridge: one long-lived `agy -p` process per thread.
//!
//! Shape-for-shape this is the Claude bridge. `agy` takes
//! `--input-format stream-json` on stdin and answers `--output-format
//! stream-json` on stdout, one NDJSON object per line, and the process stays
//! up between turns; a thread whose process has gone is resumed with
//! `--conversation <id>`, which is Claude's `--resume` under another name.
//! What differs is the vocabulary, and only the vocabulary:
//!
//! | Claude | Antigravity |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | `{"type": "system", "subtype": "init"}` | `{"event": "init"}` |
//! | stream deltas + `assistant` blocks | `{"event": "step_update"}` |
//! | `{"type": "result"}` | `{"event": "result"}` |
//! | `--resume` | `--conversation` |
//!
//! A `step_update` is the whole middle of the protocol: it carries the
//! incremental `text_delta` for agent text, the tool call and its output, and
//! a per-step `usage`. `state` moves `ACTIVE` → `DONE` and `step_type` says
//! which kind of step it is, so one arm handles what Claude spreads over a
//! stream event, an `assistant` line and a `user` line.
//!
//! ## What this bridge does *not* have, and why
//!
//! **No per-turn reasoning level.** `--effort` is a process flag here as it is
//! for Claude, so a level chosen mid-thread applies from the next resume; the
//! manager already respawns on a level change for exactly that reason.
//!
//! **No inline settings document.** Claude gets its whole containment through
//! `--settings <json>` on the command line. `agy` has no such flag: its rules
//! live in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`, which is the student's
//! own file and shared with their editor, and this app does not write other
//! programs' global config. So containment here rests on two documented flags
//! and on the cwd:
//!
//! - `--sandbox` turns on the terminal sandbox, whose writable root is the
//!   workspace — and the workspace is `agents/`, because that is what the
//!   child is spawned in.
//! - `--dangerously-skip-permissions` is the headless counterpart of Claude's
//!   `--permission-prompts none`, and is here for the same reason: under `-p`
//!   a prompt with no answerer hangs the turn for ever. The two CLIs differ in
//!   which way they resolve it — Claude auto-*denies* and is handed an allow
//!   list to compensate, `agy` has no way to take an allow list and so must
//!   auto-*allow*, with the sandbox left as the thing that actually bounds it.
//!
//! **That is weaker than the other three bridges and is recorded as such.**
//! Codex gets a seatbelt with an explicit writable-file list, opencode a
//! rendered `opencode.json`, Claude the settings document above. This one gets
//! a sandbox and a working directory. What that costs in practice is the
//! section below.
//!
//! **No rewind.** Nothing in the published protocol takes a conversation back
//! to an earlier message: `--conversation` resumes, and there is no control
//! channel to ask anything else of. [`AntigravitySession::rewind`] therefore
//! refuses rather than pretending, and the manager surfaces that refusal — a
//! rewind that quietly did nothing would leave the thread and the agent out of
//! step in the one place a student is guaranteed to notice.
//!
//! **No interrupt over the protocol either**, for the same reason. Stopping a
//! turn is a signal to the child, and the turn is closed here rather than by
//! anything the CLI says.
//!
//! ## The sandbox refuses `oculus` by its bare name
//!
//! Measured: the first `oculus list` of a thread comes back
//! `zsh:1: operation not permitted: oculus`, and the agent recovers by finding
//! the binary and running it by absolute path — at the cost of a turn. This is
//! the gap `--dangerously-skip-permissions` cannot close, because it is the
//! *sandbox* refusing, not a permission prompt: Claude's bridge answers the
//! same problem with `Bash(oculus:*)` plus the absolute path in its allow
//! list, and there is no allow list to write here.
//!
//! Two smaller consequences of the same shape. A command that exits non-zero
//! is still a *successful tool call* — `tool_info.error` is for the tool
//! failing, not for the command's exit status — so such a row is closed `ok`
//! with the failure in its output, which is what the timeline shows. And the
//! database is not reachable through a hole punched for it the way Claude's
//! `allowWrite` and Codex's `writable_files` punch one, so whether
//! `oculus task add` can open `oculus.db-wal` is the sandbox's decision.
//!
//! ## Two things the published reference gets wrong
//!
//! Both cost a turn and neither is visible from the docs, so they are written
//! down here rather than rediscovered.
//!
//! **`-p` takes the prompt as its value.** It is `--print <prompt>`, not
//! Claude's bare flag, so `-p --input-format stream-json` hands the CLI
//! `"--input-format"` as the prompt and leaves the rest as stray arguments.
//! `agy` says so and exits 2. In stream-json mode the prompt comes from
//! stdin, so the flag is `--print=` with an **empty attached value** — the
//! `=` is load-bearing, because a separate empty argument is a positional one.
//!
//! **The parameters are PascalCase.** `run_command` takes `CommandLine` and
//! `view_file` takes `AbsolutePath`, where all three other CLIs use
//! `command` / `file_path` / `path`. Read with a lowercase key every row is
//! titled with an empty string, which reads as a missing title rather than as
//! a wrong lookup — the same trap opencode's `path`-vs-`file_path` arms are
//! already in `event.rs` for.
//!
//! Both are measured off `agy` 1.2.9, as is every event shape here:
//! `fixtures/harness/antigravity-ls.ndjson` is a real session and
//! [`tests::folds_a_recorded_session`] replays it. What is still *inferred* is
//! the parameter key of the tools that recording did not exercise — the lists
//! in `event.rs` say which.
