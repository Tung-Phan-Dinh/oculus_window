//! CLI agents as the app's chat: Claude Code and Codex, driven as
//! subprocesses the user has already signed in to.
//!
//! This is the bb shape (get-bb/bb) with its plugin system taken out: one
//! bridge per provider that owns a process and folds its dialect into one
//! event stream ([`event::HarnessEvent`]), a manager that persists that
//! stream and forwards it to the webview, and a timeline that only ever
//! sees the normalized events. No API keys are involved — the CLIs carry
//! their own subscriptions, which is the whole reason for driving them
//! rather than the APIs (`docs/harness.md`).
//!
//! Every thread runs from the library's `agents/` folder, not the library
//! root. That one choice is the containment model: Claude's `acceptEdits`
//! only auto-approves edits inside the cwd and, with prompts routed to
//! `none`, refuses the rest; Codex's `workspace-write` sandbox makes the
//! cwd its only writable root at the OS level. Both were measured refusing
//! a write to `../courses/` and accepting one to `memories/`. The rest of
//! the library is readable through `..`, and the appended instructions
//! (`templates/HARNESS.template.md`) say where everything is.
//!
//! Every raw line a provider emits is also appended to
//! `agents/threads/<id>.ndjson`. It costs nothing, it is how a translation
//! bug gets diagnosed without re-running an agent, and the recordings under
//! `fixtures/harness/` that the bridge tests replay came from exactly this.
