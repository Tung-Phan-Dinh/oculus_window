//!
//! In the app the frontend owns these tables: it listens for scrape events and
//! upserts through tauri-plugin-sql. The CLI has no frontend, so it writes the
//! same rows with the same SQL — same shape, same conflict handling — and the
//! app picks the run up as if it had done the work itself.
//!
//! Schema ownership stays with the plugin's migrations. If the database does
//! not exist yet, we do not invent one; the caller reports that and keeps
//! scraping to disk.
//! `store::pool` resolves the database file before SQLite opens it, so a
//! CLI with a physical Windows AppData path shares the app's WAL and locks.
