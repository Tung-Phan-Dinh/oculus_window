//! Semantic page retrieval.
//!
//! The index is built from page *images*, not scraped text — measured on the
//! MULT20015 decks, image embeddings roughly double recall on formula slides,
//! screenshots and diagrams, where text extraction returns things like
//! `56 = 7(( 7() 7)(`. That constraint is in `CLAUDE.md` and it binds the
//! cloud path exactly as it bound the local one: `embed/raster.rs` rasterises
//! the page and the pixels are what get embedded.
//!
//! Flow: the seam's backend (`embed::backend`) rasterises and embeds each page
//! -> blobs land in `pages` alongside that page's markdown -> a query is
//! embedded by the *same* backend and ranked by dot product -> hits carry the
//! markdown for the answer and (file, page) for the deep link. Nothing
//! downstream of ranking touches a vector.
//!
//! This is deliberately a brute-force scan. A degree of coursework is a few
//! thousand pages; at 512 dims that is single-digit MB and a few milliseconds,
//! so an index would be machinery without a payoff.
//!
//! **One space, or the ranking is noise.** Every scan below filters on
//! `pages.embed_model` and `pages.embed_dim` against the space the seam is
//! currently embedding into. This is not tidiness. A dot product between a
//! Voyage vector and a Qwen one is not a worse score, it is a meaningless one,
//! and it still sorts — a search that returns confident, well-formatted,
//! unrelated slides with nothing anywhere looking broken. The columns exist
//! for this; `embed::Health::check` refuses a backend that disagrees about the
//! space for the same reason. Vectors from a retired model stay in the table
//! (they are free, and dropping them is `embed_set_engine`'s job) but they are
//! never scanned, and `IndexStats` reports them separately so "2,980 pages
//! indexed" can never mean "2,980 pages searchable".

/// The lexical half of search, as SQL: an FTS5 index over `pages.markdown`.
///
/// Page *images* are what the semantic index embeds, for the reason at the top
/// of this file — but the markdown beside them is the only place a person's
/// exact words ("Nash equilibrium", a lecturer's turn of phrase) can be found
/// verbatim, and a title search cannot see inside a deck at all. So the two
/// live side by side: this one answers as you type, the embeddings answer a
/// question. Read from the frontend
/// (`searchPageText` in `app/src/lib/db.ts`), which is why it is SQL here and
/// not a command — the app's SQLite and this one are the same file.
///
/// External content (`content='pages'`): the index stores terms, not a second
/// copy of every page, and the triggers keep it in step with whichever writer
/// moved — the app through `tauri-plugin-sql`, the CLI through
/// `app/src-tauri/src/store.rs`. `UPDATE OF markdown` and not a bare `UPDATE`,
/// because every embed writes a blob to these rows and re-indexing the text
/// for that would be work for nothing.
///
/// **A page deleted by `files`' `ON DELETE CASCADE` does not fire the delete
/// trigger** — SQLite only runs triggers for foreign-key actions with
/// `recursive_triggers` on — so the index can hold entries whose page is gone.
/// That costs ranking, never correctness: every read joins

///
/// **It narrates itself over `embed-status`**, which is the whole reason it
/// takes a `subject_id` it never otherwise needs: the pipeline row is keyed on
/// `(subject_id, relative_path)` exactly as the parse path's is, and a stage
/// that could not say which file it was moving would be a spinner, not a
/// progress story. The return value is unchanged — the caller still gets its
/// summary or its error string — so the events are additive: a caller that
/// listens to nothing behaves as before.
///
/// The events are emitted around the call rather than from inside `ingest`,
/// because `ingest` is also the CLI's path and the CLI has no window to emit
/// to. `embed::events` no-ops there anyway, but keeping the seam clean is
