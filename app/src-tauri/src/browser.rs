//! The in-app browser: one native WebView per tab, parked inside the main
//! window's content card.
//!
//! Any external link in the app opens here instead of the system browser, so
//! Canvas, Ed and Echo360 pages stay inside Oculus and — the part that costs
//! something — stay signed in. Three decisions shape this module:
//!
//! - **Pages are real WKWebViews, not iframes.** Canvas (and every other
//!   site worth opening) sends `X-Frame-Options`/`frame-ancestors`, which
//!   WebKit enforces — an iframe would render a blank box. `Window::add_child`
//!   makes each page a sibling of the app's own webview instead, stacked
//!   above it; that needs tauri's `unstable` feature (multiwebview).
//! - **Rust owns the tab list.** The page's own events (a redirect, a title
//!   change, a `target=_blank` link) land here first, so this is the only
//!   place that can be right about what each tab holds. Every change is
//!   pushed whole to the main webview as `browser-state`; the frontend
//!   mirrors the list into its tab strip and holds nothing but the address
//!   bar's draft. Page URLs never touch the React router — the route for a
//!   browser tab is `/browse/<id>`, stable for the life of the tab — which is
//!   what keeps a page load from re-laying-out the page that fired it.
//! - **The frontend says which pages are on screen and where, Rust puts
//!   them there.** A native view cannot interleave with the DOM, so a page
//!   lives in a slot the React tree leaves for it and the frontend reports
//!   that slot as insets from the window's edges (`Viewport`). Insets, not a
//!   rect: a window resize is then laid out here from the window size alone,
//!   with no JavaScript in the loop to lag behind it. Slot and visibility are
//!   both per page — a page in the content card and a page in a side panel
//!   are on screen together — so Rust never takes showing one to mean hiding
//!   another; it does what it is told, page by page. The frontend speaks up
//!   when a page's insets change — sidebar, panel drag, zoom — and when
//!   something of its own has to draw over a page, which is the one thing a
//!   native view cannot allow: it asks for that page to be hidden until the
//!   popup is gone.
//!
//! The toolbar is the fourth: **what a page knows about itself, only the
//! page can say.** Whether the back list has anywhere to go, what a find
//! matched, what the zoom is — none of that is derivable from the URL, and
//! Tauri exposes no API for the first two. They are read and driven on the
//! WKWebView directly (`nav_state`, `find_string`), which means they arrive
//! *late*: `with_webview` dispatches to the main thread and hands back
//! nothing, so the answer is written into the tab and broadcast from inside
//! the callback rather than returned to a command. Favicons are the same
//! shape for a different reason — WebKit has no public icon API at all, so
//! the icon is fetched over HTTP beside the page, once per host, and pushed
//! out on its own event so it never rides in the snapshot.
//!
//! Signed in, not for free: `canvas_session` is HttpOnly *and* session-scoped,
//! so WebKit holds it in memory only and it is gone when the app quits — the
//! scraper's snapshot on disk is the only copy that survives.
//! `seed_canvas_session` puts it back into WebKit's jar before a Canvas page
//! loads. (`/login/session_token`, the API built for exactly this, answers
//! 403 here: it wants an access token, and UniMelb has those disabled — see
//! `docs/auth.md`.) Browsing Canvas then rolls the session forward, so every
//! Canvas page load re-snapshots the cookie and the scraper inherits it.

// WKWebView. Taking the page down for the length of the dropdown is what that
// used to mean, and it blanked the card the moment you typed a character.
//
// A still is the way out of it. WebKit will render a page's visible area into
// an image — `takeSnapshotWithConfiguration:`, the API a browser's tab
// thumbnails come from — so the frontend paints that image in the slot, takes
// the live page down behind it, and draws an ordinary DOM popover over it,
// with its shadow and its rounded corners and its hover states. The page is
// frozen for as long as the list is up, which is the second or two you spend
// typing an address, and pixel-identical to what was there.
//
// Raw `msg_send!` rather than `objc2-web-kit`'s typed wrapper: the typed
// `takeSnapshotWithConfiguration_completionHandler` hands back an `NSImage`
// and is therefore gated behind a dependency on the whole of AppKit, for one
// call whose result becomes bytes immediately. `round_corners` above reaches
// for the runtime the same way and for the same reason.

/// Hands the waiting command its answer, once. WebKit calls a completion

// it declares. The other way round would be correct in one more case and cost
// a full HTML fetch every time.

// frontend keeps it in the database, so the second run of the app has the
