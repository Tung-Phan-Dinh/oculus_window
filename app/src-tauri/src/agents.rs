//! The agent-facing docs that live in the library.
//!
//! `agents/` in the data directory holds one `AGENTS.md` for every subject,
//! symlinked into each course folder, plus the stubs a human authors. It is
//! written from two places — `oculus docs` fills the whole layer on demand,
//! and a sync links whatever subjects it just scraped — so the rules about
//! what may be overwritten live here rather than in either caller.
//!
//! It also holds the memory layer an agent writes back into: `TASTE.md` for
//! standing preferences and `memories/` for facts — `memories/` itself for
//! what holds across subjects, `memories/<CODE>/` for one subject. **Nothing
//! here reads that layer back.** A thread's brief names the two buckets and
//! the agent opens them with its own tools
//! (`instructions` in `crate::harness`); the app never folds them into a
//! prompt itself. It used to, for the BYOK chat that has since been deleted,
//! and a second copy of the same files in every system prompt is a cost with
//! no reader.
//!
//! **Both buckets live under the library's own `agents/`, and that is not a
//! filing preference — it is the only place an in-app thread may write.** The
//! subject bucket used to be `courses/<CODE>/agents/memories/`, which every
//! template told the agent to use and no sandbox would let it touch: Codex's
//! writable root is the thread's cwd and Claude's seatbelt and `Edit` denies
//! say the same, so a subject fact was an instruction the app itself had made
//! impossible to follow. [`link_dir`] now moves any of those files into the
//! library bucket and leaves a symlink where they were, so an agent that
//! remembers the old path still writes into the one store. Nothing here ever
//! writes a memory.
//!
//! **Skills are the third thing written here, and the one directory all three
//! CLIs are pointed at.** `agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` is a procedure an
//! agent loads by name when a request matches it, rather than prose every
//! prompt carries. Each CLI finds them a different way, and two of the three
//! ways are the same shape: Claude Code scans `<cwd>/.claude/skills` and
//! Codex scans `<cwd>/.agents/skills`, both walking up from the working
//! directory, so each gets a relative link beside the one copy. opencode
//! takes a `skills.paths` key in its config instead, which is a line in the
//! generated `opencode.json` rather than a link. Nothing here writes outside
//! the library. They describe this binary, so they are generated and
//! overwritten like `AGENTS.md`: a skill that documents a flag the CLI no
//! longer has is worse than no skill.
