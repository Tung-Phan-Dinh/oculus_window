 * exactly as the `@` menu puts a course file's path there
 * (`app/src-tauri/src/harness/attach.rs`, `docs/harness.md`).
 *
 * Nothing is written while it is only *pending*. The composer holds the
 * clipboard's `File` or the dropped path and draws it from memory; the write
 * happens on send, so a picture pasted and then thought better of leaves
 * nothing behind on disk to sweep up.
