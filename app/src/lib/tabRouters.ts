/**
 * Every pane's router, addressed by pane id.

 * Each pane owns a memory router of its own so that leaving a tab no longer
 * unmounts its page (`app/src/components/tabs/TabPane.tsx`). That puts the
 * shell — the sidebar, the tab strip, the ⌘K palette — *outside* all of them,
 * with no router of its own to navigate: `useNavigate` there would have
 * nothing to resolve against. So the panes publish their routers here and the
 * shell reaches them by id.
 *
 * It is a module singleton for the same reason `lib/lecturePlayback.ts` is one:
 * what it holds outlives every component that touches it, and there is exactly
 * one of it per window. Nothing here is reactive — a router object never
 * changes for the life of its pane, and what the strip *does* need to re-render
 * on (the path, and whether history has anywhere to go) is reported into
 * `tabStore` by the pane instead.

 *
 * A browser tab can hold nothing but its page — the route names a native page
 * WebView Rust owns and never moves — so a shell click that would take it
 * somewhere else gets a tab of its own instead. This is the rule `tabStore`
 * used to apply from inside `trackNavigation`, which saw every move the one
 * router made; with a router per tab it belongs on the way *in*.
 *
 * Moving the tab in front also shuts its side panel: the peek belongs to the
 * page being left (see `closeActivePanel`). Opening a *new* tab does not,
 * because the tab that stays behind keeps its own page and its own peek.
 *
 * And it is where a playing lecture is asked about. That used to be a
 * `useBlocker` inside the player, which was the wrong shape twice over: a
 * router blocker is answered by whichever component happens to hold that
 * blocker's key, and if nothing answers, the router drops the navigation with
 * **nothing on screen** — a sidebar click that silently does nothing, and a
 * tab that can never navigate again. Asking here instead means the question is
 * posed before anything is committed: there is no blocked router to leave
 * stranded, and the one door the shell navigates through is the one place the
 * rule lives.
 *
 * "The shell" now includes the breadcrumb row, which is drawn inside a pane
 * but is doing the shell's job (`components/subjects/SubjectCrumbs.tsx`). It
 * used to be `Link`s onto the pane's own router, which is how a crumb became
 * the one way out of a lecture that never asked.
