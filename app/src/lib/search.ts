/**
 * One search, two fields.
 *
 * ⌘K (`app/src/components/palette/CommandPalette.tsx`) and the new-tab page's
 * own field (`app/src/pages/NewTabPage.tsx`) ask the same question, so they
 * ask it through here rather than each growing their own idea of what the
 * library contains. Adding a kind of thing to find is a change in this file
 * and nowhere else.
 *
 * What it searches: **titles** — of subjects, files, lectures, projects and
 * tasks — and the **text inside parsed documents**, through the `pages_fts`
 * index (`searchPageText`). Not the page-image embeddings: those are a cloud
 * round trip per query (`docs/retrieval.md`) and belong to a question you ask
 * Chat, not to a field you are still typing in.
 *
 * And what is not in the library at all: a URL is offered as a page to open,
 * and anything else falls through to a web search, so a field you type into
 * always has somewhere to send you.
 *
 * This file builds *data*. Icons are named, not rendered, and where a row goes
 * is a `target` rather than a closure — the surface supplies the navigation,
 * because the palette navigates the shell and the new-tab field navigates the
 * pane it is drawn in. {@link openSearchItem} is the one place that dispatch
 * lives.
