/**
 * What a file's markdown situation *is*, in one vocabulary.
 *
 * MinerU cloud is the only parser and there is no fallback beneath it, so a
 * failure is permanent until something changes: the file simply has no
 * markdown, and with it no search, no `@`-mention and no Markdown view. That
 * used to be invisible — a file row said `"failed"` or nothing at all, and the
 * viewer just didn't draw its toggle — which read as "this file is fine".
 *
 * Three questions decide which state a file is in, and they are the three the
 * `parse-status` error carries (`app/src/stores/parseStore.ts`):
 *
 * - is it moving (queued / running) or done (`quality`)?
 * - did *this file* fail, and **could a retry ever work** (`retryable`)?
 * - is the cause **the whole library's** (`latching`) — no token, a rejected
 *   token, a spent quota — rather than this file's?
 *
 * The last one is the distinction the UI must never fudge: "this file is
 * broken" and "parsing is down for everything" call for different words and
 * different fixes. `retryable` and `latching` are both **optional** — a
 * failure inherited from a previous session is only the word `error` in the
 * DB, with no column for the discriminants — so unknown is its own case and is
 * never coerced into either extreme.
