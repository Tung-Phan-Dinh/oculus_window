/**
 * Every task you have, across every project — and the ones that belong to no
 * project at all.
 *
 * A project's board is where one plan is arranged; this is the other question,
 * the one a board cannot answer: *what is there to do*. So it spans projects,
 * it opens on tasks rather than on plans, and it is where a task with nowhere
 * to go gets written down (`NewTaskButton` creates one unfiled by default —
 * migration 37, not an "Inbox" project).
 *
 * **What it gives up for spanning projects is manual order.** `position` is
 * only comparable inside one project's column, so nothing here can be
 * dragged into a slot: the board's columns are sorted (due date, then project,
 * then position) and a drag inside one is a no-op, and the table sorts by
 * header rather than by grip. `app/src/components/projects/universalTasks.ts`
 * is where that rule is written down and enforced.
 *
 * **The section's second tab**, under the `Projects · Tasks` strip the two
 * share (`SectionHeader`) — one sidebar row leads to both. Its own title went
 * with the strip's arrival: the strip names the section, and a heading on the
 * same rule would be a second title.
 *
 * **Four filters, opening on Todo**, which is the question the page exists to
 * answer. They replaced an `All tasks · Unfiled` strip: Unfiled is a *value* of
 * the project filter now, which also finally makes one project's tasks askable
 * for here. `app/src/components/projects/TaskFilters.tsx` holds their meaning;
 * this page holds their state and does the one pass. The status filter decides
 * which columns the board *has* — filter to Todo alone and there is one column
 * and nowhere to drag to, which is deliberate: a board that ignored a filter
 * the toolbar says is on would be worse. A status is changed from the table's
 * `StatusPill`, or by widening the filter.

 * and a restored tab carry a filter, and it is not worth building until it is
 * asked for.
