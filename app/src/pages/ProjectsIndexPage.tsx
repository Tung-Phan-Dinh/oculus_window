/**
 * Every project you have on, grouped by the subject it belongs to, with the
 * subject-less ones under Personal, and the ones you have put away at the
 * bottom.
 *
 * The page asks for `status: "all"` and splits the result itself rather than
 * reading the list twice: the store holds one list and one set of counts, so a
 * second query would either overwrite the first or need a second store. Which
 * makes this the only page that sees archived rows — the subject tab is a
 * working view and deliberately stays on the default.
 *
 * **The landing view of the Tasks section**, whose other tab is `/tasks`
 * (`SectionHeader`). It has no `<h1>` of its own: the strip already names the
 * section, and a heading on the same rule would be a second title — the trade
 * `TasksPage` and `ProjectPage` both make. `NewProjectButton` sits in the
 * header's toolbar row, since a project is the thing this tab makes.
