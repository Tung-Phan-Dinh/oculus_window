/**
 * The CLI agents behind Chat: where each binary was found and which version,
 * or why it was not.
 *
 * This is no longer the only reader — every model picker asks the same
 * question now, and a provider with no binary reads as *not installed* there
 * rather than offering a catalogue nothing can run — so the answer comes from
 * the shared `useBridgeHealth`. This page keeps the one thing that is its
 * alone: *Recheck* is the only caller that passes `recheck`, which is what
 * drops Rust's cached lookups and pays for a fresh probe after an install.
 *
 * It is also the only place that can *do* something about a missing one. A
 * row with no path carries *Install*, which opens the commands this machine
 * can run and runs the one that is picked
 * (`app/src/components/settings/InstallAgentDialog.tsx`). The run is held
 * here rather than in that dialog so closing it mid-install strands neither
 * the output nor the recheck the finish fires — and `recheck` is exactly the
 * hand-off, since a CLI installed a second ago stays missing until Rust's
 * cached failure is dropped.
 *
 * A row whose CLI *is* here answers the second question too — whether it is
 * signed in, and as whom. Being installed and being usable are different
 * facts, and until this stage the second one only surfaced as a red row in the
 * timeline after a turn had already failed. Sign-in status is its own shared
 * read (`app/src/hooks/useSignInStatus.ts`) rather than a field on health,
 * because Rust answers it by spawning the CLI and asking, where health is a
 * cached lookup — so *Recheck* drops both caches and asks both questions.
 *
 * opencode's row says nothing here, and that is the contract rather than an
 * omission: its credentials are per provider, so `harness_sign_in_status`
 * answers `signedIn: null` and the providers strip below is the answer.
