/**
 * The project list and the open project's tasks.
 *
 * All reads and writes go through `app/src/lib/projects.ts` — this store holds
 * what is on screen and nothing else. It deliberately does **not** call Tauri
 * `listen()`: `app/src/hooks/useBackendEvents.ts` is the single app-level
 * bridge for backend events, and a store that subscribed on its own would be a
 * second one.
 *
 * **A write does not re-read.** Every write in the lib layer fires
 * `PROJECTS_UPDATED_EVENT` on `window`, and that is the only refresh path:
 * a page showing project data listens for it and calls {@link reload}, the way
 * the calendar listens for `CALENDAR_UPDATED_EVENT`. Refreshing here *as well*
 * meant a single drag cost two full task reads plus a project-list read, and
 * the two paths could land out of order. Having only the event left has a
 * second virtue: a write made in the UI and a write made by the chat agent
 * through the CLI arrive by the same door, so nothing can work for one and not
 * the other. What the wrappers below still do is the bookkeeping a re-read
 * cannot express — clearing {@link activeId} when the open project stops being
 * something to look at.
