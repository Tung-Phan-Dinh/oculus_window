/**
 * Notion-style top tabs. Each tab is a real navigation context — a router and
 * a mounted page of its own (`app/src/components/tabs/TabPane.tsx`) — and this
 * store is the strip's view of them: which exist, what order they are in,
 * which is in front, and for each, where it sits and whether its history has
 * anywhere to go. The panes report the last two; nothing here navigates
 * except the one case below that has to.
 *
 * A tab can be **split**: two panes side by side inside the one tab, the
 * second opened with ⌥⌘T (`app/src-tauri/src/menu.rs`). A pane, not a tab —
 * the strip still shows one tab, titled by its main half — because the split
 * is a place to put something *beside* what you are reading, and promoting it
 * to a tab of its own is exactly what you were avoiding by splitting.
 *
 * The unit everything below a tab is keyed by is therefore the **pane id**,
 * not the tab id: a router, a side-panel peek, a playing lecture and a Recent
 * entry all belong to one pane. A tab's main pane uses the tab's own id — so
 * an unsplit tab is indistinguishable from what it was — and a split gets an
 * id of its own from the same counter, which is why `AppTab extends PaneState`
 * rather than holding a pane.
 *
 * Closing one is not quite final: the store keeps a short stack of what was
 * closed (`closed`, `reopenTab`) so ⇧⌘T can put the last one back at the
 * index it had. A browser tab is the exception to the shape of that — see
 * `ClosedTab` — because its route names a page Rust has already destroyed.
 *
 * A browser tab is a tab whose path is `/browse/<id>`: it stands for a native
 * page WebView that Rust holds, and its path never changes — the page
 * navigates, the route does not. What keeps it pinned to its page is
 * `navigateActive` in `app/src/lib/tabRouters.ts`, on the way in. A split
 * pane can hold one too (that is what the split is *for*, half the time), and
 * `useBrowserTabs` reconciles pages against both halves.
