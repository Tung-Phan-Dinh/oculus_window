/**
 * Files dropped onto one element, from Tauri's drag-and-drop events rather
 * than the page's.
 *
 * Tauri's own handler sits in front of the webview, so a file dragged in from
 * Finder never reaches a React `onDrop` — the page sees nothing at all.
 * Switching that handler off would hand file drops to WebKit and take in-page
 * dragging with it (CLAUDE.md), so Tauri's events are the ones to listen to.
 *
 * **Listen as the webview, not the window** — and in this app that is not the
 * choice the docs imply. A drop is delivered as a *window* event only when the
 * runtime built that webview as the window's own content
 * (`WebviewKind::WindowContent`); otherwise it is a *webview* event, emitted
 * to `EventTarget::Webview` — and Tauri's `filter_target` never matches a
 * `Window` listener against a `Webview` emit. This app turns on tauri's
 * `unstable` feature, because that is what `Window::add_child` needs for the
 * in-app browser (`app/src-tauri/src/browser.rs`), and that same feature flips
 * the *main* window's own webview to `WebviewKind::WindowChild`
 * (`tauri-runtime-wry`, where the kind is picked under `cfg(feature =
 * "unstable")`). So every drop here is webview-addressed, whatever the window
 * holds. A window listener subscribes without error, reports success, and is
 * then never called once — nothing to see but a drag that does nothing.
 *
 * **The position is in points, whatever its type says.** Tauri hands it over
 * as a `PhysicalPosition`, and it is not one: wry reads macOS's
 * `draggingLocation` and subtracts it from the view's frame height without
 * ever multiplying by the backing scale factor, so what arrives is the
 * window's own logical coordinates. Dividing those by `devicePixelRatio` — the
 * conversion the type asks for — halves every point on a retina screen, which
 * puts the whole window in its top-left quarter. So the scale is *measured*
 * instead of assumed: points to CSS pixels is the viewport's width over the
 * window's own logical width, which is `1` until the page is zoomed and stays
 * right when it is. It is re-read on a resize and again as each drag enters,
 * because page zoom changes both numbers under us.
 *
 * `over` is true while a drag is inside the element, for whatever the caller
 * wants to draw.
