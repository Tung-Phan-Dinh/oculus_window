/**
 * The model picker's providers, with each one's catalogue and whether its CLI
 * is actually on this machine.
 *
 * Every picker in the app — the chat composer, the lecture dock's composer and
 * the per-job rows in Settings → AI — used to assemble this itself, in three
 * byte-for-byte copies of a fetch-gate plus a `claude ? static : fetched` map.
 * Three copies is three places to forget when an agent is added, and the map
 * was the kind of ternary that answers "not Claude" with the wrong list rather
 * than a type error. So it is one hook, and it names no provider at all: which
 * catalogues are compiled in and which are fetched is a property of the
 * `PROVIDERS` entry (`app/src/lib/harness.ts`), so a fourth agent is an entry
 * there and nothing here.
 *
 * `needed` is which providers are worth asking a CLI about, and it is a
 * parameter because the three call sites genuinely differ: a composer wants
 * the one provider its picker is showing, while the settings page wants every
 * provider some job row is set to — a page opened on a Codex job should not
 * spawn the other CLIs to fill in lists nobody is looking at. Everything else
 * about them was identical.
 *
 * A provider nobody has asked about reports `loading`, which is what it is:
 * its list is not here, and switching the picker to it is what asks. Each is
 * asked once per mount. Empty or failed requests get one more attempt after
 * each successful shared health recheck, so installing or signing into an
 * agent enables an already mounted composer without retrying on every render.
 *
 * **Once per mount, plus once per catalogue edit.** opencode's list is its CLI
 * catalogue less whatever the student hid, per
 * `app/src/lib/opencodeCatalogue.ts`, so a student ticking models in Settings
 * changes what this hook should have answered — and the composer is usually
 * already mounted behind it. That is not the same as dropping the once-per-
 * mount rule: the expensive thing is the CLI call, and the catalogue's version
 * counter changes only when Settings writes, which is a handful of times in a
 * session rather than once a render. So the ask is re-armed on a version
 * change. The old list stays on screen until the new one
 * lands, since a tick should not blank the menu for a beat.
 *
 * **Health rides alongside the catalogue rather than replacing it.** A
 * provider whose binary was not found keeps the models it would have — Claude's
 * compiled-in list is still the list `claude --model` takes, and `modelsFor`
 * is used to resolve a selection, not to draw one — and it is the picker that
 * refuses to offer them. That keeps the gate in one place for all three, and
 * it is the same gate: before health lands, `unknown` means every provider
 * draws exactly as it drew before this existed. The one thing health does here
 * is spare a known-missing provider the fetch that could only fail.
