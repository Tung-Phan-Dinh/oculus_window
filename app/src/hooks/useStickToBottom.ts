 * Follow the stream, but only from the bottom.
 *
 * A `scrollTo` on every delta forced a layout of the whole thread per token
 * *and* yanked the view back down whenever the reader scrolled up mid-turn;
 * growth is watched instead, and the scroll only happens while the bottom is
 * where they already are.
 *
 * Shared because the Chat page and the lecture player's dock draw the same
 * timeline (`docs/harness.md`), and two copies of this would be two answers to
 * "did the reader scroll away" — the one thing the timeline gets wrong most
 * visibly.
 *
 * Both boxes are watched, because the bottom moves for two reasons. The
 * content grows — a token lands — and the scroller itself shrinks, which is
 * what a composer does to the box above it as it wraps onto another line.
 * Only the first changes `scrollHeight`, so watching the content alone left
 * every ⇧⏎ pushing the last rows behind the composer with the scroll position
 * untouched and the view no longer at the end.
 *
 * `threadId` is what resets the pin: a thread you have just opened starts at
 * its end, whatever the last one was scrolled to. `live` re-hangs the observer
 * when the scroller itself is swapped out — an empty thread draws a different
 * box from a thread with rows in it.
