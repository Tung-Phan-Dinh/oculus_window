/**
 * Keeps the tab strip in step with Rust's browser tab list. Rust is the
 * source of truth for which browser tabs exist; the strip is the source of
 * truth for their order among the app's own tabs and which one is in front.
 * So every snapshot is reconciled one way: a page Rust has that no pane is
 * showing is opened as a tab in front (a link was clicked, or a page popped
 * one), and a pane whose page Rust no longer has is closed.
 *
 * Panes, not tabs, because a split half can hold a page too — that is half of
 * what splitting is for. A page adopted into a split is therefore *not* given
 * a tab of its own, and a split navigated away from its page hands that page
 * back to the strip on the next snapshot, which is what keeps a page from
 * being stranded with nothing showing it.
 *
 * It is also where **history is written**. Rust sees the page loads, but the
 * snapshot carries everything a visit is — the URL as it commits, the title
 * once WebKit has parsed it — and the browser tables belong to the frontend
 * the way every other table does.
 *
 * Two rules keep that honest. A visit is recorded when the page has
 * **finished** loading, never when it commits: a commit fires for every hop of
 * a redirect chain, and one Canvas SSO bounce would otherwise leave four rows
 * for one destination. And the last URL recorded per tab is remembered here,
 * so a snapshot fired for something else — a title landing, a sibling tab
 * loading — does not count the same page twice.
 *
 * Mounted once, in AppLayout: it is the strip it reconciles, not any one
 * page.
