/**
 * Background parse sweep — the recovery path for files that missed their
 * parse (app closed mid-queue, a parse died, a sync ran while parsing was
 * down). Every so often it re-requests a few PDF-backed files in selected
 * subjects that are not at `quality` yet; the Rust side skips whatever
 * already exists.
 *
 * The name is historical, like the `quality` status itself: there is one
 * parse tier now, and `'quality'` is simply what a finished parse is called
 * in the DB.
 *
 * ## Why this is careful now
 *
 * It used to be free to be wrong. A failure fell back to a local parser, so
 * re-kicking a permanently broken file cost a little CPU. **Every parse is
 * now a metered cloud call.** Left as it was, this loop would resubmit every
 * permanently-failed file — a corrupt PDF, one over the size limit, one
 * rejected outright — every 15 minutes forever, and a bad token or an
 * exhausted quota would march the entire library through the same error one
 * batch at a time, burning the day's allowance on parses that cannot succeed.
 *
 * So two gates, both reading the discriminants the `parse-status` error
 * carries (`parseStore`):
 *
 * 1. **`retryable === false` is never re-kicked.** The failure said retrying
 *    this file can never work; asking again is pure spend. An *unknown*
 *    retryability (a file that failed in a previous session, where all the DB
 *    keeps is the word `error`) is still eligible — otherwise the recovery
 *    path this hook exists to be would die — so a permanently bad file costs
 *    at most one attempt per app launch instead of four an hour.
 * 2. **A latching failure stands the sweep down.** No token, a rejected
 *    token, exhausted quota: the next file would fail identically, so the
 *    sweep stops rather than proving it 8 files at a time. The latch lifts
 *    the moment any parse gets anywhere (`parseStore.update`), which includes
 *    every hand-driven route — a sync, the pipeline row's retry — so the user
 *    fixing the cause is what resumes it. `LATCH_PROBE_AFTER_MS` is the
 *    safety valve for the one condition that heals on a clock rather than on
 *    an action: a daily quota. After it, the sweep spends exactly one file to
 *    ask whether the condition still holds.
 *
 * If this ever looks like over-engineering worth simplifying: the simple
 * version is a quota fire.
