/**
 * One box: the text, then a row carrying the model picker on the left and the
 * usage wheel and send/stop button on the right. Enter sends, Shift+Enter
 * breaks a line — bb's keys.
 *
 * While a turn runs the box still takes a message: it is *queued* rather than
 * sent (Rust holds it — `Queue` in `app/src-tauri/src/harness/mod.rs`) and it
 * appears as a pending bubble at the end of the thread. Stop then keeps its
 * word — nothing more goes out — and hands back what was waiting, which
 * arrives here as `restore` and lands in the box rather than being lost.
 * So while a turn runs there are two buttons and not one: stop is always
 * reachable, and send appears beside it as soon as there is something to
 * queue.
 *
 * The row's controls are all one height (24px). A send button larger than the
 * picker beside it reads as the box's subject rather than its verb.
 *
 * Scope sits *above* the box rather than in the control row, and only while
 * the thread is new: it is a choice made once, before the first message, and
 * an open thread cannot change it. Showing a dead control under every message
 * for the rest of the thread spends the row on nothing.
 *
 * `@` opens a file menu, narrowed to the thread's subject. Picking a file
 * writes its **library path** into the message — nothing is read here and no
 * content is attached. The agent has the library in front of it and its own
 * tools for opening a file; a path is all it was ever missing, and one it can
 * hand straight to `oculus read`.
