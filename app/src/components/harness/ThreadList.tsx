 * The armed state of a row's delete: the confirm itself, and a way out.

 * does not focus a button when you click it, so the blur this leans on never
 * fired, and the row simply stuck on the confirm with no way back. Escape
 * cancels too, and the ✕ is the visible version of the same, for when the way
 * out should not have to be guessed at.
 *
 * **Every button here commits on `mousedown`, and that is what makes the
 * delete work at all.** The same WebKit rule cuts the other way once this
 * button holds focus: pressing it is a mousedown on something WebKit will not
 * focus, so it clears the focus it *had* — this button's — and the blur fires
 * before the click does. The blur cancels, React unmounts the confirm
 * synchronously, and the click then lands on a node no longer in the tree. So
 * *Yes* was never delivered and deleting a thread silently did nothing, on
 * every click, for the same reason the ✕ beside it was already written this
 * way.
