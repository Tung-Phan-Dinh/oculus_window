/**
 * The composer's model-and-reasoning switcher, ported from bb's

 *
 * The trigger reads `[mark] Model Name Level ⌄`; the menu is a strip of
 * provider tabs (marks, underlined when active), the models of the active
 * provider, and a row of reasoning levels under a rule. **Nothing inside
 * closes it** — model, level and agent are one decision made in three clicks,
 * and a menu that shut on the first of them sent you back to the trigger to
 * finish the thought. It closes the way a menu you are done with closes:
 * outside click, Escape, or the trigger again.
 *
 * There is no "default" on either row. A turn always names a model and a
 * level, so what the composer shows is what the CLI is told — nothing is
 * decided out of sight by whatever the agent happens to be configured with.
 * The picked model's own default level is what a fresh pick lands on.
 *
 * Levels come off the *model*, not the provider: `claude --effort` takes
 * five, while Codex declares its own per model.
 *
 * **An agent that is not installed says so here, where the choice is made.**
 * The menu has three answers about a provider's models and they are not the
 * same answer: health has not come back yet (draw what we always drew), the
 * binary was not found (name the CLI and offer the way to Settings → AI), and
 * the CLI is there but reported nothing — an opencode with no credentials —
 * which is still "No models available". The first was the whole bug: Claude's
 * catalogue is compiled in, so a student without Claude Code browsed a full
 * list and learned the truth from an error row after sending. Health is a
 * field on `PickerProvider` rather than a test on an id, so this stays one
 * gate for three agents and costs a fourth nothing.
