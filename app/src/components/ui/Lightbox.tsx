/**
 * Something flat, opened out: the whole window, zoomable and pannable.
 *
 * Two things in the app are drawn small and meant to be read large — a
 * mermaid figure sized to the column it sits in (`DiagramLightbox`), and a
 * picture attached to a question, which the thread draws as a card a few
 * centimetres wide (`ImageLightbox`). Both want the same viewer, so there is
 * one: the caller hands over the content and its natural size, and everything
 * below — the fit, the zoom, the pan, the toolbar — is shared.
 *
 * **Panning is the container's own scroll; only the scale is a transform.**
 * The picture sits in an `overflow-scroll` box, which is what `PDFViewer` does
 * and for the same payoff: two-finger panning, momentum, scrollbars and
 * keyboard scrolling all arrive for free and behave the way every other
 * scroller in the app does. What the zoom changes is a `scale()` on an
 * SVG host of fixed size, inside a layout box that carries `natural × zoom`
 * so the scroll extent still tells the truth.
 *
 * That split is not the CSS-`zoom` mistake the app made once before
 * (`AppLayout`, root `CLAUDE.md`). Inside a CSS-`zoom`ed subtree WebKit
 * reports pointer coordinates in visual pixels and element rects in layout
 * pixels, so the two disagree; under a `transform` both are visual, so the
 * anchor maths below — pointer position against `getBoundingClientRect` — is
 * measuring one space. Measured, scaling the transform rather than resizing
 * the `<svg>` is about 3× cheaper per frame (0.3ms against 1.0ms for this
 * app's flowcharts), because the SVG's own layout never re-runs.
