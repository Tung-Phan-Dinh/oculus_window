/**
 * The tint a column's pill wears.
 *
 * Kind alone is not enough: Todo and In progress are both `kind: "active"`,
 * and the pill *is* the whole Status cell in the table, so two different
 * states read identically. So the ramp is kind plus position — how far along
 * the project's own board the column sits — and it runs from no fill at all to
 * the brand accent:
 *
 *   backlog → outline only · queued → grey fill · in flight → brand · done → success
 *
 * The last active column takes the brand because `brand` is this palette's
 * accent for work in flight (the root `CLAUDE.md`), and the columns before it
 * step down towards the neutral end rather than taking hues of their own —
 * a board is not a legend, and three saturated pills in a Status column would
 * read as three warnings.

 * all: the column and `done_at` are one fact, and only `moveTask` reads the
 * project's board to learn whether the destination is a `kind: "done"` one.
 *
 * `project` may be `null`: an unfiled task has no project, and its columns are
 * the default board `boardOf` hands back — the same four `moveTask` will check
 * the pick against.
