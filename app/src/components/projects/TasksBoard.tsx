/**
 * Every task there is, on the board every project is born with — Backlog,
 * Todo, In progress, Done.
 *
 * The columns are `DEFAULT_COLUMNS` itself (`UNIVERSAL_COLUMNS` in
 * `./universalTasks.ts`), **handed in as a prop** so the board never has to
 * know a filter exists: the page passes the whole list, or the subset the
 * status filter leaves standing. A card is drawn in the column whose *id* its
 * own board's column has, falling back to that column's kind — which is what
 * keeps Todo and In progress apart here, since a kind alone cannot tell them
 * apart. Dropping a card in another column writes that column back onto the
 * card's *own* board, by id if it has one and by kind otherwise — so a project
 * that renamed Todo still receives a drop onto Todo, and a board with no Done
 * column refuses a drop onto Done instead of inventing one.
 *
 * **Within a column there is no manual order, so a drag inside one is a
 * no-op.** `./universalTasks.ts` carries the long version: `position` is only
 * comparable inside one project's column, so this column is *sorted* — by due
 * date (nulls last), then project, then position — rather than arranged. The
 * order is `UNIVERSAL_ORDER`'s, carried through from `getAllTasks`, the same
 * trade `columnEntries` makes with `getTasks`'s ORDER BY: the rows arrive in
 * the order they are drawn in, and this file only groups them. Nothing here
 * re-sorts, so handing it rows in another order would quietly change what the
 * board means.
 *
 * **A subtask is a plain card, not an indented one.** `ProjectBoard` draws it
 * under its parent because within one project the parent is right there and
 * the indent is the cheapest way to say so. Here the sort has already put the
 * two wherever their due dates put them — possibly pages apart, possibly in
 * different columns — so there is nothing to indent *under*, and the card
 * names its parent on a line of its own instead.
