 * A lecture open in the side panel. Expanding promotes it to the lecture page
 * — in this tab, or in a new one on ⌘-click — which either way is a handover
 * of the video elements rather than an interruption (`lib/lecturePlayback.ts`).
 *
 * Fullscreen stays off here for the same reason it always did: the panel is
 * furniture beside a page that stays where it is, and an element-fullscreen
 * player inside it would have to escape a Radix portal to do anything. The
 * dock is off for a reason of its own — a panel beside the video inside a
 * panel beside the page leaves neither of them readable (`allowDock` in
 * `LecturePlayer`). The page route, where both default on, is where they live,
 * and the expand control in the header above is the way there.
