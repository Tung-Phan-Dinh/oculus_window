 * tab in front has open (`sidePanelStore`). Docked means the page beside it is
 * genuinely narrower — which is what keeps the native browser webview honest,
 * since `BrowserPage` measures its own slot and re-places the webview when the
 * slot resizes, where an overlay could only ever hide it.
 *
 * Width and collapsed are the panel's, not any tab's: dragging it wider in one
 * tab widens it everywhere.
 *
 * Expanding is the same width transition run the other way: the frame sweeps
 * out to the full card and the page underneath is committed behind it, so the
 * peek *becomes* the page instead of vanishing and being replaced. ⌘-click
 * skips the sweep and opens a tab, where the peek is not the thing taking the
 * page over.
 *
 * The frame is always mounted, at zero width when nothing is open, so opening
 * and closing are a width transition on an element that already exists rather
 * than a mount and an unmount — which nothing can animate. What it *draws*
 * lags the store by one animation (`drawn`), so a closing panel still has
 * contents to slide out with.
