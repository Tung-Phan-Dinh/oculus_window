/**
 * Installing a missing CLI agent, from the row in Settings → AI that says it
 * is missing.
 *
 * The shape is the one that was agreed rather than the obvious one, and the
 * difference is the point: this does **not** own the student's package
 * manager. Homebrew may not be here and installing it needs `sudo`, which a
 * GUI app has no way to prompt for; and a `curl … | bash` fired by an app that
 * never showed the command is the wrong trust posture for the one app that
 * also holds a Canvas session. So:
 *
 * 1. Rust says which of `brew`, `npm`, `bun` and `curl` this machine has,
 *    found the way the CLIs themselves are found — a login shell, because a
 *    Dock-launched app has launchd's PATH and `brew` is not on it.
 * 2. Every route is shown as its **literal command**, with Copy. That is the
 *    path that always works — a locked-down machine, or a student who would
 *    rather run it in their own terminal — so it is there even beside the
 *    button that would run it.
 * 3. *Install* runs exactly the command above it, through `$SHELL -lc` so the
 *    profile's PATH is there, and the click on that button is the only
 *    confirmation there is. Nothing needing elevation is ever offered; Rust
 *    refuses one too.
 * 4. The run's last event triggers a **recheck** — see `useAgentInstall`,
 *    which owns that so closing this dialog cannot skip it.
 *
 * The output stream is listened to in that hook rather than routed through
 * `useBackendEvents` into a store, which is this app's rule for background
 * jobs. An install is not one: it is a foreground thing the student is
 * watching, it has no meaning once Settings is left, and a package manager's
 * output is tens of kilobytes a store would then keep for the session. This
 * dialog is its surface, which is also why nothing here is a toast — this app
 * has none.
