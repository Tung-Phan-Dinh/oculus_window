/**
 * Everything about opencode's providers, in one dialog: what is connected,

 * composer is allowed to offer.
 *
 * It replaced a version of all this inlined into Settings → AI, which was the
 * wrong shape twice over. A 218-row search box and a connected list are not a
 * settings *row*; and the thing that actually had to be built — per-model
 * ticks over a provider that can contribute three hundred of them — has no
 * chance of fitting on a page beside four other sections.
 *
 * **Three views, one dialog.** `providers` → `models:<id>` → back, held in
 * local state rather than as three `<Dialog>`s, because they are one task: a
 * student who connects OpenRouter is going to check it and then untick two
 * hundred rows, and a stack of dialogs would make each step feel like leaving
 * the last one. The connect flow is the exception and genuinely is a second
 * dialog — it is a form with its own browser round trip
 * (`OpencodeConnectDialog.tsx`), and it is rendered over this one unchanged.
 *
 * **The dialog's first read is what starts opencode.** Listing providers means
 * asking the app's `opencode serve`, and a settings page being *opened* is not
 * a reason to spawn a CLI — so the section above draws a button, and mounting
 * this component is the click. After that the answer is cached for the
 * window's life in `opencodeAuth.ts`.
 *
 * **Connected leads, because it is the only thing there is to remove**, and
 * removal has two shapes that are not the same fact. A provider with a
 * credential is disconnected. A provider whose `source` is `config` is
 * connected because the student's own `opencode.json` declares it: there is no
 * credential to delete, and Oculus must never edit that file — so the honest
 * action is to hide it from Oculus, which is a fact about this app and nothing
 * else. That is `hiddenProviders` in `app/src/lib/opencodeCatalogue.ts`.
 *
 * **What the model list is, and what it is not.** The rows come from
 * `harnessOpencodeModels()` — opencode's whole catalogue — and never from
 * `PROVIDERS`' opencode `fetchModels`, which is already filtered by the very
 * store this dialog edits. Reading through that filter would mean a model
 * could only be unhidden if it were not hidden.

 * scroll. Every group competes with every other for the same column, and the
 * one that loses is always the results — a student with five providers signed
 * in was left about two rows of room to scroll two hundred in, and pinning the
 * top half only moved the squeeze.
 *
 * **The query is the mode.** Empty, the body is the student's own providers,
 * and the whole dialog is theirs to scroll. Typing gives the body over to the
 * matches, because looking for one of 218 providers is a find rather than a
 * browse, and nothing about the connected list helps with it. So the two
 * things never share a column at all, the search stays reachable from anywhere
 * in either, and neither can starve the other of height.
