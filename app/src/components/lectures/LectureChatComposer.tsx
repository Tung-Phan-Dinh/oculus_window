/**
 * The dock's composer.

 * it.** The two boxes answer different questions. That one opens a
 * conversation and so carries the choices that are made once — the subject
 * scope above the box, the `@` menu that turns a filename into a library path
 * — and it has the room for them. This one is 300px wide beside a playing
 * video, and both of those are already answered: the lecture fixes the
 * subject, and the agent has been handed the recording folder in its
 * instructions (`docs/harness.md`), so a file is typed as a path. What it adds
 * instead is the moment, which the page composer has no playhead to build.
 * Threading a `compact` flag and four "not here" props through one component
 * would have made the shared one harder to read than both of them are apart.
 *
 * Enter sends, Shift+Enter breaks a line — bb's keys, and the same ones next
 * door. While a turn runs the box still takes a message: Rust queues it, so
 * stop and send sit side by side exactly as they do on the page.
