 * class Firefox's built-in reader is built on, minus its chrome. This file
 * used to hand-roll all of it on top of `react-pdf`: a page window driven by a
 * guessed aspect ratio, a `transform: scale()` preview folded into a real
 * raster on an idle timer, and an anchor record that measured rects and
 * centring slack across two frames to keep the pinched point still. Every one
 * of those has a counterpart in the library that is better tested than ours
 * could be — `updateScale({ origin })` for the anchor, `--scale-factor` plus
 * `drawingDelay` for the preview, its own virtualisation for the window — and
 * the hand-rolled versions each carried a visible bug: the commit yanked the
 * document toward the middle, and a pinch jittered because WebKit reports it
 * twice.
 *
 * So what is left here is the parts that are this app's rather than the PDF's:
 * the pill toolbar, the three layouts mapped onto pdf.js's scroll/spread
 * modes, the select-versus-pan tool, and the two gesture paths WebKit needs
 * (see the dedupe below, which is still ours because the library does not bind
 * desktop pinch — Firefox's `app.js` does, and we are not shipping that).
 *
 * pdf.js is loaded through `@/lib/pdfjs` rather than imported directly, for
 * ordering reasons set out there; that it also keeps ~1.7 MB out of the entry
 * chunk is the second reason.
