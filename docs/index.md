# Oculus docs

Oculus is a Tauri 2 desktop app that scrapes a student's UniMelb coursework —
Canvas pages and files, Ed Discussion threads, Echo360 lecture recordings —
into a local library, parses every PDF to markdown, embeds each page as an
image, and answers questions by retrieving the right pages. Chat is a coding
agent the student already has — Claude Code or Codex — run from the library
with the `oculus` CLI as its tool surface (see [harness.md](./harness.md)).

These pages are the map: where things live, how the pieces connect, and the
measured facts the design rests on. Conventions (toolchain, UI rules, git)
live in the root `CLAUDE.md`, not here.

## Reading order

Windows setup, packaging, platform boundaries and the upstream update workflow
are in [windows.md](./windows.md).

| Page | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| [architecture.md](./architecture.md) | The three processes, how they talk, the data directory, `oculus.db` |
| [sync.md](./sync.md) | The scrape engine: Canvas modules, Ed threads, Echo360 lectures, HTML→md |
| [auth.md](./auth.md) | Canvas session cookie, keep-alive, Ed `x-token`, Echo360 LTI |
| [sidecar.md](./sidecar.md) | The Python process: fast/quality PDF parsing, lifecycle, endpoints |
| [retrieval.md](./retrieval.md) | Page-image embeddings, the `pages` table, query flow |
| [harness.md](./harness.md) | Chat as a CLI agent: the Claude Code and Codex bridges, containment, the timeline |
| [llm.md](./llm.md) | The dormant BYOK layer: provider config, keychain keys, streaming, spend limits |
| [calendar.md](./calendar.md) | Class times, deadlines and recordings on one grid |
| [projects.md](./projects.md) | Assignments broken into tasks: the Overview, the board, a page per task, and the CLI the agent plans through |
| [chapters.md](./chapters.md) | Splitting a lecture recording at its topic boundaries — the detector, the agent job, and what is not built yet |
| [frontend.md](./frontend.md) | Routes, layouts, stores, hooks, the UI system |
| [cli.md](./cli.md) | The `oculus` binary — headless sync from a terminal |
| [cli-reference.md](./cli-reference.md) | Every command and flag — generated from the binary, not hand-kept |
| [development.md](./development.md) | Building and running each piece |

## Repo layout

| Path | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `app/src/` | React 19 frontend (Vite, Tailwind v4, shadcn/ui) |
| `app/src-tauri/src/` | Rust: Tauri commands, scrape engine, retrieval, sidecar supervisor |
| `app/src-tauri/src/bin/oculus.rs` | The headless CLI over the same engine |
| `sidecar/` | Python (uv): PDF parsing (pymupdf4llm + MinerU) and Qwen3-VL embeddings |
| `docs/` | These pages |
| `.agents/skills/` | Shared skills: `read-docs`, `write-docs`, `check-doc-drift` |
| `.claude/skills/` | Symlink to `.agents/skills/` for Claude Code |

## Status honesty

Built: Canvas SSO + sync, Ed Discussion sync, Echo360 download + player, the
two-tier PDF pipeline, page-image retrieval, chat as a CLI agent over it
(Claude Code or Codex, driven as a subprocess — see
[harness.md](./harness.md)), projects: assignments broken into tasks, each
project opening on an Overview (a brief, tags, a pinned calendar event, what is
next) with its tasks on a board, a table or a timeline behind a Tasks tab and a
page per task, all of it writable by the agent through the CLI
([projects.md](./projects.md)), a
**home launcher** at `/` — the composer over today's agenda, what you were
last in, and your projects — and an in-app browser: external links open as
tabs in Oculus's own tab strip, signed in to Canvas. When a doc or UI string
implies more than this, the doc is wrong — fix it.

Built: **lecture chapters**. Boundaries are detected, named by a CLI agent and
stored from the command line (`oculus lecture chapters`) or the app, then read
as a dock list, a current-chapter strip and scrub-bar ticks in the player.

Part-built: **lecture recap**. The backend job segments a recording at its
visual changes, asks a CLI agent for short windowed notes and stores each
validated window (`oculus lecture recap`). Its model is configured in Settings
→ AI, but the player tab that reads those rows is the next stage.
[chapters.md](./chapters.md#lecture-recap) describes the shared pipeline and
the remaining UI boundary.

Dormant rather than built: the **BYOK API layer** — provider config, keychain
keys, streaming, spend limits — which the CLI-agent bridges replaced. Nothing
routes to it and it is the planned third bridge, so it is described in
[llm.md](./llm.md) in the present tense; that is a description of code that
exists, not of a feature you can use.

Removed: **automations and the Inbox** — the trigger/condition/action canvas
that delivered sync digests. It worked, but it was a detour from the core, so
it was cut rather than carried. The last version that has it is the
`automations` branch (its docs page went with it); master keeps migrations 18,
20 and 21 so the tables still exist, unused, and reinstating needs no
migration. Scheduled sync went with it — sync is manual-only now.
