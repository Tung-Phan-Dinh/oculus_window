# Auth & sessions

Three services, three credentials — but everything derives from one Canvas
session cookie.

## Windows integration

`app/src-tauri/src/auth.rs` and `app/src-tauri/src/browser.rs` put the sign-in
window and remote browser tabs in the same WebView2 profile under
`%APPDATA%\com.tchan.oculus\canvas-session`. The privileged app webview keeps
its own profile. A new browser tab starts blank, restores the saved Canvas
cookie through Tauri's native `set_cookie` API, then navigates. Cookie reads
run away from WebView2's event-loop thread to avoid deadlocks. Disconnect
clears the browser profile through the native API and closes its tabs;
Windows keeps live profile files locked, so disconnect does not delete that
directory while WebView2 owns it.

Passwords, TOTP seeds, MinerU tokens and provider keys use Windows Credential
Manager through keyring's Windows backend. The Canvas cookie remains the
existing local snapshot; no credential is copied from a macOS installation.

The closed-app keep-alive in `app/src-tauri/src/keepalive.rs` uses Windows
Task Scheduler. Each Windows user gets a task named with their SID, running
with limited privileges while that user is logged in. It invokes the bundled
`oculus.exe auth tick` through hidden PowerShell every selected number of
hours, including on battery, and catches up after a missed run. No Windows
password or elevation is needed. Installation still follows a successful
headless Canvas sign-in or the explicit Settings switch; disabling it saves
the same opt-out marker as macOS. Startup repairs a moved executable path.
The scheduler's action receives an encoded, literal-path invocation so spaces,
apostrophes and other punctuation in an installation path remain data.

The launchd details below describe the retained macOS implementation.

## Canvas

- **API tokens are not an option.** UniMelb Canvas has disabled self-service
  access tokens (the "New Access Token" button renders `disabled`; only an
  admin can issue one). The app therefore authenticates every request with a
  snapshotted `canvas_session` cookie. Do not re-propose `Bearer` auth
  without re-verifying that admin setting — and note the button's *string*
  is present either way; only the `disabled` attribute tells you.
- **Sign-in genuinely needs a browser**: Canvas authenticates through the
  university's SAML IdP, so login happens in a real (visible) app WebView.
  The captured cookie is persisted to the data dir in plaintext, alongside
  an auth-flag file whose presence means "we believe we have a session".
- **The session has no cookie-side expiry.** The server tracks lifetime and
  extends it on use, so periodic requests are what keep it alive. There is
  no remember-me cookie; once dead, the session must be rebuilt from
  scratch — either by [automated sign-in](#automated-sign-in) or by hand.

### The in-app browser gets the same session

External links open inside Oculus (see [frontend.md](./frontend.md)), and a
Canvas page there has to be signed in — but the snapshot on disk is not
something WebKit will read.

- **The cookie has to be put back by hand.** `canvas_session` is HttpOnly
  *and* session-scoped, so WebKit keeps it in memory only: it dies with the
  process, and the plaintext snapshot is the sole surviving copy.
  `browser::seed_canvas_session` writes the snapshot into WebKit's shared jar
  through `WKHTTPCookieStore` (Tauri exposes no cookie setter) at startup and
  before each Canvas page. The snapshot carries no domains — it is a bare
  `name=value` header — so every pair is re-scoped to the Canvas host, which
  is exactly what the scraper sends over the wire anyway.
- **Pass a completion handler.** `setCookies:completionHandler:` invokes
  whatever it was handed once the network process replies; a nil block
  segfaults the app *seconds later*, from a stack that names only WebKit.
- **`/login/session_token` is not the shortcut it looks like.** Canvas's own
  "log a browser in from an authenticated backend" endpoint answers 403 to a
  session-cookie request — it wants an access token, and those are disabled
  here. Same wall as above, one layer down.
- Browsing Canvas in-app rolls the session forward like any other request, so
  a page load there re-snapshots the cookie and the scraper inherits the
  fresher one. The snapshot is deduplicated by name on the way out: UniMelb
  sets a few cookies on the parent domain, and they come back from WebKit
  next to the seeded copies scoped to the Canvas host — without the dedupe,
  every Canvas page load grew the file by three cookies.

### Keep-alive, two layers

- **App open**: a thread in `app/src-tauri/src/lib.rs` re-probes the saved
  session every 6 hours and emits `canvas-auth-expired` if it is rejected.
- **App closed**: `app/src-tauri/src/keepalive.rs` installs a macOS
  LaunchAgent that runs `oculus auth tick` on a schedule via launchd. The
  tick probes, re-signs-in on rejection, and reports into
  `session-keepalive.log` in the data dir — launchd has no console, and a
  non-zero exit would only read as a crashed job, so every outcome is a log
  line and exit 0.

  The agent was once a standalone `/bin/sh` script that re-implemented the
  cookie merge in awk, and it could only *ping*: on 401 it had nowhere to go,
  so it logged the failure and gave up. Weeks of `ping failed: HTTP 401` is
  what a keep-alive that cannot re-authenticate looks like. Running the CLI
  means the agent shares one probe, one cookie merge, and one sign-in with the
  app.

  **The CLI ships as a Tauri sidecar**, declared in `externalBin` alongside
  ffmpeg and staged by `app/scripts/stage-cli.mjs` from `beforeBuildCommand`.
  The bundler does copy *some* sibling cargo binaries into `Contents/MacOS/`
  — `retrieval_smoke` lands there unasked — but not `oculus`; the selection is
  undocumented and appears to key off the name, which is no basis for the one
  binary the keep-alive depends on. Staging it explicitly costs a build step
  and is deterministic.

  That build step has a chicken-and-egg: `tauri-build` validates every
  `externalBin` path, and it runs for *every* bin in the crate, `oculus`
  included — so building the CLI requires the staged CLI. `stage-cli.mjs`
  writes an empty placeholder for that one build and replaces it with the real
  binary, removing it again if the build fails, so a zero-byte sidecar can
  never reach a bundle.

  `cli_path()` then resolves the CLI as a sibling of `current_exe`
  (`Contents/MacOS/oculus`), falling back to `target/release/oculus` under
  `tauri dev`. The plist stores that path absolutely, so
  `keepalive::repair_path` re-points an installed agent on startup when the
  bundle has moved — an agent calling a binary that is gone still "runs" every
  six hours and is indistinguishable from a working one until the session
  dies.

  **A rejected probe is not the same as an unreachable one.** The tick
  re-authenticates only on `Rejected` — on `Unreachable` it logs and waits,
  rather than spending an Okta sign-in attempt to discover the wifi is down.

  Neither layer can beat an absolute session cap or a forced IdP re-auth; when
  those fire, the user signs in by hand.

  **The agent installs itself only once a headless sign-in has actually
  succeeded** (`keepalive::ensure_installed`, called from the success path of
  `run_sign_in`). The gate is deliberately not "credentials are stored":
  recovery needs the TOTP factor, and an org that answers only with Okta
  Verify push or WebAuthn cannot be driven from launchd — there the agent
  would wake every six hours, fail, and log noise forever. Turning the
  Settings switch off writes a `keepalive-disabled` marker, so the next
  automated sign-in does not put it straight back.

### Automated sign-in

`app/src-tauri/src/okta.rs` rebuilds a dead session without a browser. The IdP
is Okta at `sso.unimelb.edu.au`, running **Identity Engine** — its sign-in
widget is a thin client over a JSON state machine at `/idp/idx/*`, so the
whole exchange can run in Rust: introspect the login page's state token,
answer each *remediation* Okta offers, then replay the SAML app URL to get an
assertion to POST to Canvas.

The loop is written against remediation **names**, not a fixed script, because
the order Okta asks for factors in is a policy setting that can change without
notice. It answers two factors:

- **password** — from the macOS keychain.
- **TOTP** (Google Authenticator) — generated locally from a stored seed.

**Answer the challenge before reading the chooser.** OIE offers
`select-authenticator-authenticate` alongside *every* `challenge-authenticator`
as the "verify with something else" escape hatch, so taking the chooser as the
next step re-picks the same authenticator forever without ever answering it.
The loop therefore answers whatever `currentAuthenticator` says is being
challenged, and falls through to the chooser only when that is a factor it
cannot answer.

It cannot answer Okta Verify push or WebAuthn; those need a human, which is
the point of them. When Okta offers only those, `LoginError::UnsupportedFactor`
carries the labels it *did* offer, so a failure names its own cause instead of
needing a packet capture.

The state token bootstrapped from the login page is a ~5 KB JWE, and the page
names `stateToken` several times — in inline script logic as well as in the
widget config. Taking the *first* mention yields a fragment that introspect
rejects as "The session has expired", which reads like an expiry problem and
is not one; `state_token_candidates` therefore takes every quoted value of
plausible shape. Note also that `/idp/idx/introspect` is the one call whose
field is named `stateToken` — every later call echoes back `stateHandle`.

**A TOTP secret cannot be recovered by observing codes.** A code is
`HMAC-SHA1(seed, unix_time / 30)` truncated to six digits — a one-way function
of a 160-bit seed. The seed is shown once, at enrolment, as the QR code and
the "setup key" beside it; getting it means re-enrolling the factor. TOTP is
implemented in-tree (SHA-1, HMAC, RFC 6238) rather than pulled from a crate,
and pinned by the RFC 4226/6238 test vectors.

**Canvas issues an anonymous `canvas_session` to the first visitor**, before
any authentication — the SAML start collects one on its way to Okta. So
"do we hold a `canvas_session`?" is not a success condition; `complete_saml`
only accepts one after it has actually posted an assertion, and `sign_in`
then proves the cookie against `/api/v1/users/self` before persisting it. A
session is never written to disk unverified, so a failed automated attempt
cannot clobber a working one.

Both probe sites in `app/src-tauri/src/lib.rs` call
`okta::try_auto_recover` before declaring a session expired, so a lapsed
session is normally rebuilt silently. `useAuth().connect()` tries the same
path before opening the login window. Credentials are entered in Settings →
Canvas (`app/src/components/settings/AutoSignIn.tsx`) or via
`oculus auth setup`.

**Every path that establishes a session must write the auth flag.** The
startup probe reads it before it reads anything else — no flag means "fresh
session" and the cookie beside it is never even looked at. `paths::
mark_authenticated` is the one writer; `oculus auth auto` used to skip it,
which left a valid cookie on disk and the app still opening disconnected.

A rejected password clears the stored one rather than letting the keep-alive
replay a wrong password every six hours until Okta locks the account.

**Security shape.** Password and TOTP seed live in the same keychain on one
machine, so against anything already running as this user the second factor is
no longer a second factor — the same posture as a password manager that stores
TOTP beside the password. It does not weaken the account against anyone who is
not already on this Mac.

### Startup probe

On launch, if the auth flag exists, the app is *optimistic* (state =
connected) while a background thread replays the cookie server-side:
`Valid` confirms, `Rejected` clears the flag (the SSO profile is kept so
re-login is one tap) and emits `canvas-auth-expired`, `Unreachable` stays
optimistic — an offline start is not an expired session.

## Ed Discussion

Ed has no third-party OAuth; every API call carries the web app's `x-token`
JWT. `app/src-tauri/src/ed.rs` mints it automatically by walking the Canvas →
Ed LTI 1.3 launch (course tabs → tool page → `oidc_login` → Canvas
`/api/lti/authorize` → `launch` → one-shot `?_logintoken=` →
`POST /api/login_token`). Tokens live ~2 weeks, are renewed via
`POST /api/renew_token` on each sync, and a dead one is simply re-minted from
Canvas. `oculus auth ed <TOKEN>` remains as a manual override. The redirect
walk must keep cookies **per-host** — the Canvas cookie must never be sent to
edstem.org.

## Echo360

No stored credential at all: each session is minted on demand from the Canvas
cookie via the course's LTI external-tool form (see
[sync.md](./sync.md)). The app caches the resulting session per course in
`app/src-tauri/src/lectures.rs`.
