# The `oculus` CLI

A second binary in `app/src-tauri` that drives the same scrape engine as the
app, with no window involved. Useful for terminal syncs, cron jobs, and
debugging. `app/README.md` carries the full command reference; this page is
how it fits the architecture.

On Windows the binary is `oculus.exe`, its library is under
`%APPDATA%\com.tchan.oculus`, and the app and CLI use the same path resolver.
Secret prompts use native console echo control through `rpassword`.
`auth login` locates the adjacent `app.exe` desktop executable (the CLI is
`oculus.exe`, which Windows also matches as `Oculus.exe`), while `auth tick`
also serves the per-user Windows scheduled task described in [auth.md](./auth.md).
Generated course instructions are copied on Windows rather than requiring
symlink privileges. Artifact names avoid Windows device names and trailing
periods and shorten oversized components with a stable suffix, using the
same names on every platform.

Three kinds of command, and the difference between two of them matters.
`run`, `index` and `auth` **write the library**: they are the app's engine
without the window, and everything they write is a copy of something the
university already has, so a bad run is repaired by running it again.
`search`, `grep`, `read`, `files` and `calendar` only **read**, and exist so a
coding agent, or a person at a prompt, can query the library without the UI and
without a protocol in between: one binary, one `--json` flag, no per-agent
registration and no tool schemas resident in a context window. `project` and
`task` **write the user's own content** — the projects, boards and tasks the
app draws ([projects.md](./projects.md)) — which is a different kind of write
from a scrape: nothing upstream has a copy, and `oculus task rm` is gone for
good where a deleted course file comes back on the next sync. That is why
those commands refuse an unknown column instead of guessing, why a whole
breakdown goes in as one transaction, and why the destructive one says in its
own `--help` that there is no undo.

`lecture` reads no upstream copy at all: it decodes a recording already on disk
(see [chapters.md](./chapters.md)), which is why it has no cache to invalidate
and re-running it is the whole story. `lecture candidates` writes nothing at
all. `lecture chapters` and `lecture recap` write **derived** rows — not a
copy of anything upstream and not the user's own work either, but something
regenerable from the recording — so `--force` is the door for replacing them.
These are also the commands that spend a model's quota, which is why each
leaves an existing result alone unless asked. A recap additionally requires
the transcript on disk: its notes describe what was said over a slide, not
only what the frame shows.

Two commands stand outside that split. `docs` documents the whole agent-facing
surface to the agents that use it, and `agent` runs one of those agents for a
single turn through the app's own bridges — the headless proof that a bridge works, with nothing recorded
(see [harness.md](./harness.md)). Its `--subject` takes a course code and
appends the same scope the app's picker does, which is how that section of
the instructions gets read without opening the window.

## How it connects

- `--memory-cap <MB>` is global, so `oculus --memory-cap 8192 index` and
  `oculus index --memory-cap 8192` are equivalent. Minimum 5120. It calls
  the running sidecar's `/limits` before the command, requires that sidecar
  to be available, and is not saved to the app's preferences. The budget
  covers the whole sidecar tree; at 5 GB local quality may not fit.
- The CLI reads the same session cookie and writes the same `oculus.db` the
  app uses — a CLI sync shows up in the app and vice versa. But it **never
  creates the database** (schema stays with the app's migrations), so a
  fresh machine must open the app once first; until then the CLI scrapes to
  disk and says so.
- `oculus auth login` launches the app for the SAML browser step and polls
  for the cookie the app saves — that path needs the app because a push or
  biometric challenge needs a human.
- `oculus auth setup` stores the username, password and TOTP setup key that
  let `oculus auth auto` do the whole Okta sign-in headlessly, no app and no
  browser. `oculus auth forget` clears them. See [auth.md](./auth.md) for
  what the setup key is and why it cannot be derived from codes.
- `oculus auth tick` is one keep-alive cycle — roll the session forward, and
  rebuild it headlessly if Canvas has rejected it. It is what the macOS
  LaunchAgent runs on a schedule, so it prints nothing, writes to
  `session-keepalive.log` in the data dir, and always exits 0: launchd has no
  console, and a non-zero exit only reads as a crashed job. Safe to run by
  hand when you want to know whether the agent's path still works.
- `run -s` scrapes, then parses and embeds each written PDF **one file at a
  time**. The sidecar serializes local heavy work but batches cloud quality
  independently. Both halves are idempotent; re-running is cheap.
- The sidecar returns once its *fast* pass has markdown; the quality parse
  finishes in the background after the command exits. `oculus index` folds
  that improved text into the database without re-downloading anything.
- `run -s` also refreshes each subject's Canvas calendar (class times and due
  dates) into `calendar_events` after the scrape — the CLI has no sync options
  to gate it with, so it always runs. See [calendar.md](./calendar.md).
- Subject codes match on prefix (`MULT20015` finds `MULT20015_2026_SM2`).
- Lecture ids match on a unique prefix, as printed by `oculus list -l`.
  `lecture recap` resolves that prefix, then runs the configured
  `Job::LectureRecap`; `--provider`, `--model` and `--effort` override one run
  without changing the registry. Its roughly ten-minute windows run in
  sequence and commit independently, so an error can leave the completed
  windows from this run visible. See [chapters.md](./chapters.md#lecture-recap).

## The query half

- **`search` needs the sidecar and says so.** The query is embedded by the
  same Qwen3-VL model that embedded the page images — there is no text index
  to fall back on — so semantic search only works while something is running
  the sidecar, which in practice means the app is open. When it is down the
  command **fails with exit 1 and names `oculus grep`** rather than returning
  zero hits. That is deliberate: a caller handed an empty result concludes
  the library has no answer and stops; a caller told why it is empty tries
  the other door. An empty index fails the same way, naming `oculus index`.
- `search` takes a *set* of subject ids, not one — a prefix code legitimately
  matches the same subject in two terms. `retrieval::search_in` is the
  multi-subject entry point; `retrieval::search` is the one-subject wrapper
  the Tauri command still calls. Both embed the query once.
- **`grep` covers both halves of the library, which is why it is not just
  ripgrep.** Markdown (Canvas pages, announcements, Ed threads) is on disk;
  PDF page text is only in the `pages` table. A caller reaching for ripgrep
  over `courses/` silently misses every slide deck. `grep` scans in subject
  then path order and stops at its limit, so the two sources interleave
  instead of the database half crowding out the disk half.
- `read` addresses PDFs by the **same page numbers** `search` reports and the
  app's viewer shows, because all three read `pages.markdown` keyed on
  `(file_id, page_no)`. For an Office document that means the derived sibling
  PDF's pages, via `paths::doc_pdf_rel`.
- File lookup is tiered, not fuzzy: exact path, then exact filename, then
  case-insensitive filename, then path substring — and only the best tier
  that matched anything is considered. A tie inside a tier is reported, never
  guessed.
- `--json` is global and shaped for a caller that will not read prose: one
  document on stdout, and on failure `{"error": "..."}` on **stderr** with
  exit 1. `status --json` carries the index stats too, so a caller can find
  out whether `search` will work before trying it.
- These commands never start the sidecar and never scrape. A read command on
  a machine where the app has never run reports what is missing and stops.

## The planning half

- **`project` and `task` are the agent's write surface**, and the database is
  the only door: the app's board reads these same rows live, which is why
  nothing here asks for `oculus.db` to be opened directly. Nine subcommands —
  `project list|show|create|update` and `task list|add|update|move|rm` —
  all honouring `--json`. The rules they enforce, and why, are in
  [projects.md](./projects.md); what is CLI-shaped about them is below.
- **A breakdown goes in as one `--batch`, not a command per task.** `oculus
  task add -p <ID> --batch -` reads a JSON array from stdin (or a file) and
  writes it in a single transaction, so a rejected item rolls the whole thing
  back rather than leaving half a plan on the board. An item names its parent
  either by an existing task id or by the `key` of an **earlier item in the
  same array**, which is how a parent and its subtasks go in together; `key` is
  never stored. That contract is the one thing here an agent writes by hand, so
  it is spelled out in `oculus task add --help` and asserted by a test that
  parses the documented JSON.
- **An unknown column is refused, with the ids the board does have.** `--column`
  is free text an agent typed, and a task filed under a column the project
  lacks is not misfiled but invisible — every view renders columns. Naming the
  real ids in the error means the next attempt does not cost a second command
  to find out what the board is called.
- **`task move` is the only command that changes where a task sits** — its
  column, its order and whether it is finished are one fact, and `task update`
  deliberately cannot touch them. Finishing something is moving it into a
  `done` column, not a flag.
- **A project points at exactly one subject, so `-s` breaks ties differently
  here.** Prefix matching is the same as `run` and `calendar`, but a bare code
  legitimately matches the same course in two terms; `one_subject` resolves
  that in favour of the **current** term, and a tie that survives that is
  reported with the full codes rather than guessed. Omitting `-s` makes a
  personal project rather than an ambiguous one.
- **Everything this binary writes is marked `source: agent`**, so the board can
  show which rows it did not write itself.

## Docs for the agents that use it

`oculus docs` fills `agents/` in the data directory, so a coding agent pointed
at a course folder can work without anyone explaining Oculus to it. Sources
live in `app/src-tauri/templates/`; everything except the CLI reference is
written by `app/src-tauri/src/agents.rs`, which **the sync path calls too** —
see the bullet on scaffolding in [sync.md](./sync.md).

```
<data>/agents/
  AGENTS.md       one copy, symlinked into every course folder
  OCULUS-CLI.md   rendered from this binary's own help
  OCULUS.md       stub
  TASTE.md        stub — standing preferences
  memories/       cross-subject; MEMORY.md index stubbed beside them
<data>/courses/<code>/
  AGENTS.md → ../../agents/AGENTS.md
  agents/memories/    subject-scoped, with its own MEMORY.md index;
                      INSTRUCTIONS.md goes here too
```

Three different lifetimes, which is the whole design:

- **Generated, always overwritten.** `OCULUS-CLI.md` walks clap's command tree
  rather than any list, so a new subcommand or flag appears the moment it
  exists and a test asserts the coverage. Nothing is hand-written, because an
  agent trusts a file over `--help` — a stale reference is worse than none.
  `AGENTS.md` is overwritten too: it is one universal file, which is what
  removes any per-course copy to keep in sync.
- **Stubbed once, then the user's.** `OCULUS.md`, `TASTE.md` and the
  `MEMORY.md` index in each memory folder are written only when absent. They are the one thing in `agents/` a human authors, and
  overwriting them would be the only unrecoverable thing this command could
  do. So is `agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md` in a course folder, which nothing writes
  at all — it is where per-subject instruction lives now that `AGENTS.md` is
  universal.
- **Linked, never clobbered.** The course-folder `AGENTS.md` is a *relative*
  symlink, so the library stays movable. A wrong target is relinked; a real
  file is left alone with a warning, because it is somebody's work.

Details worth not rediscovering:

- Rendering is pinned to 88 columns with colour off, so the output depends on
  the binary and not the terminal that ran it. Wrapping needs clap's
  `wrap_help` feature, which is why it is enabled in `Cargo.toml`.
- Global `--json` and `--memory-cap` are hidden below the root: clap would
  otherwise repeat their full text under all sixteen subcommands, which was a
  third of the file.
- At ~12 KB `OCULUS-CLI.md` is a *pull* document. `AGENTS.md` says when to
  open it rather than pasting it into every context — the same reason
  `AGENTS.md` itself stays short.
- `bun run cli:install` runs `oculus docs`, so the reference always describes
  the binary actually on `PATH`. `bun run cli` deletes the old binary first:
  cargo will otherwise report success while leaving a stale one in place,
  which would document the wrong build.
- The same rendering also lands in the repo as
  [cli-reference.md](./cli-reference.md), written by
  `app/scripts/gen-cli-docs.mjs` from `oculus docs --stdout`. It runs from
  `beforeBuildCommand`, straight after `stage-cli` has built the release
  binary — the one moment in the toolchain where a current binary is
  guaranteed to exist, so a bundle cannot ship a CLI its reference does not
  describe. It is deliberately *not* on `beforeDevCommand`: `tauri dev` never
  builds the CLI, so hooking it there would add a release build to every dev
  start. Run `bun run docs:cli` by hand after changing the CLI if you want the
  repo copy current before a bundle.
- Why the repo needs a copy at all: `OCULUS-CLI.md` only exists on a machine
  where the CLI has been installed. The repo copy is for a reader — or an
  agent working on Oculus rather than on a library — with no built binary.
  This page stays prose; the generated file carries the flags.
- **A sync links new course folders on its own**, so `oculus docs` is for
  refreshing the reference after a rebuild, not for catching up on enrolment.
  It is still the only thing that writes `OCULUS-CLI.md`, and its `link_all`
  sweep still covers folders no sync touched — an old term, or a stray
  directory an earlier sync left behind. `link_course` is narrower by design:
  it takes a subject code, so a sync annotates only what it actually scraped.
