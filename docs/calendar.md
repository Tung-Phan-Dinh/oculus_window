# Calendar

Class times, deadlines and lecture recordings on one grid. Most rows come from
Canvas's calendar API during a sync; the page only reads them, so it works
offline and pages between months without touching Canvas. Two further layers
are Oculus's own: a `note` table it writes, edits and deletes itself, and the
tasks on a project's board, which it reads live and never copies — see the
notes under "The five layers".

## Where

## The five layers

| Layer | Source | Why it exists |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `class` | Canvas `calendar_events?type=event` | The published timetable, when staff publish one |
| `due` | Canvas `calendar_events?type=assignment` | Deadlines, including quizzes (a quiz has an assignment shell) |
| `lecture` | The `lectures` table already synced from Echo360 | The fallback timetable for a subject Canvas is silent about |
| `note` | The `local_events` table | Anything Oculus wrote itself, rather than read from Canvas or Echo360 |
| `task` | The `project_tasks` table, read live | A deadline you set yourself: a dated, unfinished task, on a project's board or on none at all ([projects.md](./projects.md)) |

**The `note` layer is the one the user writes.** Its first writer was the
automations feature (removed — see [index.md](./index.md)), which is why rows
carry a `source` of `automation` or `manual` and why the card says which; for a
while after that removal nothing wrote the layer at all. `EventDialog` writes it
now, through `createLocalEvent` / `updateLocalEvent` in `app/src/lib/db.ts`, and
`source` is always `manual` — an edit deliberately leaves the column alone, so
fixing a typo on a row an automation left behind does not relabel it as
something the user typed.

**The dialog is mounted once, in `app/src/layouts/AppLayout.tsx`, and raised
through a store.** Two things open it and they are not in one subtree: the
Calendar header's New event button, and the Edit on an event's own card — which
is `EventPopover`, rendered by all three calendar views *and* by Home's Today
list. That is the shape `leaveLectureStore` already uses for the same reason.
Nothing is read back first: a local row's kind, subject, dates and notes are all
on the `CalEvent` the card is holding. The popover is controlled only so it can
dismiss itself as it hands over — a popover and a modal trapping focus at once
is a way to leave the page unclickable.

## How it connects

- **Not a scrape phase.** Calendar rows land in the database only — nothing is
  written under `courses/`, so there is no artifact to report and no
  file-manifest skip to honour. Like the Echo360 lecture list, it runs *after*
  a scrape completes: the frontend calls `calendar_sync_events` per subject and
  writes the rows (`app/src/hooks/useBackendEvents.ts`), and the CLI calls
  `calendar::fetch` then `store::replace_calendar_events` itself. Both are
  gated by the `calendar` sync option (`app/src/components/sync/SyncSettings.tsx`);
  the CLI always runs it.
- **What Oculus writes lives in its own table, and that is the whole point.**
  The Canvas write below deletes a subject's rows and re-inserts them, so a
  deadline Oculus derived and put on the grid would survive exactly until the
  next sync. `local_events` (migration 22) is therefore separate, never touched by a
  sync, and merged in by `loadCalendar` after the Canvas rows and the lecture
  layer — after, so a locally written `class` cannot suppress a subject's
  Echo360 recordings. Its `subject_id` is nullable (`ON DELETE SET NULL`): a
  personal reminder need not belong to a subject, and dropping a course must not
  take your own rows with it. Subject-less rows file under a "Personal" key that
  is kept out of the subject colour palette, or one note would recolour
  everything. Because nothing else will ever clean these up, every local row is
  editable and deletable from `EventPopover`.
- **A task is deliberately *not* copied into that table.** It would be the
  obvious move — a task has a date and a subject, and `local_events` is the
  table for rows Oculus owns — and it is wrong, for the reason the paragraph
  above ends on: nothing cleans `local_events` up. A task re-dated, ticked off
  or deleted on its board would leave a copy on the grid that no sync and no
  sweep would ever come back for. So `loadCalendar` reads `project_tasks`
  live, through `getAllOpenTasks` in `app/src/lib/projects.ts`, which drops the
  undated and the finished in SQL — the grid then cannot show a task that is
  not still a task. The cost is a refresh signal rather than a table: the page
  listens for `PROJECTS_UPDATED_EVENT` as well as `CALENDAR_UPDATED_EVENT`, and
  every project write fires it (see [projects.md](./projects.md)).
- **A project can be pinned to an event, and the pointer goes the other way.**
  An assignment's project answers to a deadline Canvas already put on the grid,
  so `projects.event_id` (migration 33) holds a `CalEvent.id` —
  `app/src/lib/calendar.ts`'s own id, so one column addresses all three
  tables: a Canvas row is its Canvas id, a local one is `local_<n>`. What is
  pinned is the thing on the grid rather than a row in any one table, which is
  the only way to spell it once. It is **deliberately not a foreign key**: the
  Canvas write below deletes a subject's rows and re-inserts them, so a
  `REFERENCES … ON DELETE SET NULL` would drop every link on the floor halfway
  through a sync, even though the ids come back identical. So the pin is
  resolved live against `loadCalendar()`, the mirror of what the task layer
  does in the other direction — and a pin that no longer resolves says so and
  offers to clear itself, rather than drawing nothing and leaving the user with
  a link they set and cannot see. `task` rows are excluded from the picker: a
  task event *is* a project's own row read back onto the grid, so pinning a
  project to one would be a loop. See [projects.md](./projects.md).
- **Editability and deletability have the same three answers.** A local row is
  both, because nothing else will ever clean it up and no sync will ever
  overwrite it. A Canvas row is neither, since a sync would only write it
  straight back. And a **task** is neither either, for a third reason: the
  calendar only *reads* `project_tasks`, and everything you
  would do to a task — re-date it, finish it, delete it with its subtasks — is
  on its board. So the card links through to the project instead, carrying the
  project's name because a bare task title on a grid is not enough to act on.
- **A task with no project labels itself by the task alone.** Since migration
  37 a task can belong to no project at all ([projects.md](./projects.md)), so
  `getAllOpenTasks` joins the project **LEFT** and `projectId`, `projectName`
  and the subject all come back `null` for such a row. Nothing on the grid has
  to special-case it: the card is the title and the date, `EventPopover` and
  `EventRow` already draw the project line only when there is one, and a NULL
  subject falls to the same "Personal" key a subject-less project does, which
  keeps it out of the subject colour palette. It links nowhere, because there
  is no board it came from — the one thing an unfiled task on the grid cannot
  offer.
- **A note is an instant, and so is a task** — the same rule deadlines follow,
  and the same machinery (`isInstant` in `app/src/lib/calendar.ts`). What the
  two of them share beyond that is `isSelfImposed`, the other predicate in that
  file: an instant *you* set rather than one a course set for you, drawn in a
  quieter register — a lighter tint, a lighter mark — everywhere it appears.
  That is one rule three views were each about to grow their own copy of, so it
  lives with the model.
- **The write replaces, it does not accumulate.** A class moved or cancelled in
  Canvas has to disappear, and an upsert into a growing set would leave the old
  occurrence on the grid forever. Both writers delete the subject's rows and
  re-insert, which is safe only because the fetch is always a whole course's
  calendar — keep it that way if the query ever grows a date window.
- **Repeating classes are already expanded.** Canvas materialises a series
  server-side, so a semester of lectures is many rows and there is no
  recurrence rule stored or interpreted anywhere. `all_events=true` fetches the
  whole span in one walk rather than guessing a window that would clip the
  first or last teaching week.
- **A sectioned class is a parent plus children.** When staff schedule one
  event per tutorial section, Canvas returns a parent spanning them all with
  the real occurrences as `child_events`. Rendering the parent would show every
  section's tutorial as if the student attended all of them, so children
  replace their parent, filtered to the sections the user is actually enrolled
  in — `include[]=sections` on the courses API returns the *calling user's*
  sections, which is what makes that filter possible. When no child matches
  (sections unknown, or scoped some other way) every child is kept: a crowded
  calendar beats an empty one.
- **The query asks about the course and its sections, then deduplicates.**
  Canvas has returned a section occurrence nested under its parent in some
  cases and top-level in others; requesting both contexts and deduplicating by
  id makes the result the same either way.
- **Recordings fill in only where Canvas is silent.** A subject with `class`
  rows suppresses its `lecture` layer (`loadCalendar` in
  `app/src/lib/calendar.ts`) — otherwise a published lecture and its Echo360
  recording would draw the same class twice. In practice most UniMelb subjects
  publish nothing to the Canvas calendar, so the recordings *are* the
  timetable; see [sync.md](./sync.md) for how that list is fetched.
- **Past and future are drawn differently, and "now" is live.** Elapsed hours
  carry a grey wash, finished events drop their subject colour for the neutral
  `chart-other`, and today's column gets a time line — all driven by
  `app/src/hooks/useNow.ts`, which re-renders on the minute so a window left
  open all day does not quietly lie. Two consequences worth knowing: the week
  containing today stretches its hour range to keep "now" on the grid (at 10pm
  every class is over and the grid would otherwise stop at 7pm with nothing
  marking where you are), and the wash is mixed from `muted-foreground`, not
  `surface` — `surface` sits within a couple of percent of the page background
  and is invisible as a wash.
- **A deadline is drawn at its hour when the grid covers that hour**, as a slim
  marker laid over the classes rather than a block competing with them — a
  submission is an instant, not a span. The marker is centred on the exact
  minute and then clamped back inside the grid: deadlines cluster at the ends
  of the day (11:59pm above all), and one centred there hangs half off the
  bottom edge. It is nudged by at most half its own height rather than snapped
  to the nearest hour, which would redraw an 11:59pm cutoff at 11pm or at
  midnight — a time it is not due. The ones the grid cannot reach (an
  11:59pm cutoff against a grid that stops at 7pm) collect in a labelled strip
  above it. Every deadline is in exactly one of the two, never both. **The
  strip is named after the loudest layer in it** — "Due", "Tasks" or "Notes",
  with the matching mark beside the word — because it now collects three kinds:
  a week whose unplaceable instants are all tasks filed under "Due" would be
  making a claim about a deadline that does not exist. A real deadline, or an
  all-day class (which has no quieter name), still takes the heading whenever
  one is present. Deadlines are also kept out of `hourRange`: letting an
  11:59pm cutoff stretch the grid would pin every week open to midnight for one
  marker.
- **A class block is clamped into the grid too.** Canvas publishes
  cutoff-shaped *events*, not only assignments — a peer-review "class" that
  runs 11:59pm to 11:59pm is a `class` row of no length, and drawn at its own
  minute with the minimum block height it hangs off the bottom of the card.
  A block that has real length is shortened to the last row rather than moved,
  so an 11pm–12:30am class still starts at 11pm; only one that cannot fit at
  all rides up against the bottom edge
  (`app/src/components/calendar/WeekView.tsx`).
- **The agenda's row is shared with Home.**
  `app/src/components/calendar/EventRow.tsx` is the row the Agenda view and
  Home's Today list both render, extracted when Home needed the same grammar —
  the same move `EventMark` made one level down. It takes `now` as a prop
  rather than calling `useNow()` itself: a list is one clock, and a row that
  owned its own would put a minute timer behind every line.
- **A deadline never has a class's shape**, and neither layer of self-imposed
  instant borrows one either. `app/src/components/calendar/EventMark.tsx` is
  the one vocabulary all three views draw from: a filled flag is a Canvas
  deadline, a filled pin is a note, an **outline** checkbox is a project task,
  and a dot is anything that occupies time. The silhouettes differ rather than
  only the colours, because a task's date must not read as a submission cutoff
  at a glance; the mark is shared rather than branched per view because the
  flag-or-dot test had already grown a copy in each of the three views, and a
  new kind would have drifted between them.
- **The week grid sizes itself to what it must show**: the classes in view, an
  hour of padding either side, a floor of 8am–6pm, and — on the week containing
  today — the current hour, which is why the grid reaches 3am when you open it
  at 4am. An event running past midnight counts as ending at 24:00 rather than
  at its clock time, or 11pm–12:30am would read as "ends at 0:30" and shrink
  the grid below the block it needs to hold.
- **Nothing can hide outside the fitted range, by construction.** The split in
  `app/src/components/calendar/WeekView.tsx` is exhaustive: an event is either
  timed (and `hourRange` is computed *from* that set, so the grid covers it) or
  it is a deadline/all-day (and lands in the grid when the hours reach it, in
  the strip when they do not). There is no third case to leak through. A `24h`
  toggle in the grid's corner still opens the full midnight-to-midnight day and
  remembers the choice — the guarantee is structural, but "these hours do not
  exist" reads as a limitation, and the whole day should be reachable when you
  want to look.
- **The week has a floor width and scrolls sideways under it.** The page is not
  the window: the docked side panel takes a resizable bite out of it, and seven
  columns divided into what is left get small fast — small enough that a class
  block was an ellipsis, and a block halved again by `packLanes` for an overlap
  was not even that. Below `MIN_GRID_PX` in
  `app/src/components/calendar/WeekView.tsx` the grid stops compressing and the
  view scrolls horizontally instead. **One scroller carries both axes**, with
  the day headers and the deadline strip pinned to its top and the hour gutter
  pinned to its left, so the times stay readable however far the week is pushed
  sideways. The three stacked grids — headers, strip and hour grid — share one
  column template and have to move together, which is why they sit in the same
  scrollport rather than one inside another: a `sticky` gutter resolves against
  the *nearest* scrollport, so with the old vertical scroller wrapped around
  the hours alone, `left: 0` only ever pinned the hours to the content's own
  left edge and they slid away with the columns.
- **A month cell shows as many chips as it measures room for.** The count used
  to be the constant four, which is right only at one window height: with the
  side panel open, or simply a short window, the fourth chip was sliced in half
  by the cell's `overflow-hidden` and no "+N more" said anything was missing.
  `MonthView` observes the grid's own height, divides by the six rows it always
  has, and works the capacity out from there — and trades one chip for the
  "+N more" link whenever there is a remainder, which always fits because the
  link is shorter than a chip.
- **The header's controls wrap; they never clip.** Title, period, the week/month
  stepper, the view switch, New event and Refresh had been one no-wrap row, so
  the page's `overflow-hidden` simply cut the last pill in half once the panel
  opened. The title shrinks and its period truncates, and the right-hand group
  wraps onto as many lines as it needs. New event sits with the title rather
  than at the end of that group: it is the page's one action, the rest are about
  looking, and keeping it out of the run is what lets the run stay on one line.
- **Times are stored exactly as each source gives them.** Canvas sends ISO8601
  UTC, Echo360 sends local wall clock with no zone marker, and `new Date` reads
  each correctly. A task's `due_at` is a third shape, and is two shapes at
  once: ISO8601 from the app, SQLite's own `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` from the CLI,
  whichever writer got there — so tasks go through `sqliteUtcToMs`
  (`app/src/lib/format.ts`), which reads both. Nothing normalises any of them
  on the way in: a room booking is a wall-clock fact, and rewriting it to UTC
  would only add a way to be wrong.
